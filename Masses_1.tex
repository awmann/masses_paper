\begin{abstract}
The mass-luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing need for both a higher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematic effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between \mks\ and $M_*$ spanning 0.70$M_\odot$ to 0.075$M_\odot$. The relation is derived from 61 nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a precision better than 1\% in the best cases. We use these masses and resolved $K_S$ magnitudes to calibrate the \mmk\ relation within a Monte Carlo Markov Chain framework. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine masses of single stars to 2-3\%, which we confirm by testing the relation on stars with individual dynamical masses from the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit relation beyond measured $M_*$ uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in the \mmk\ relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input parallaxes. The effect of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation is likely negligible for metallicities in the Solar neighborhood (0.8$\pm$2.4\% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). This weak effect is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (at $5\sigma$). A sample of binaries with a wider range of abundances will be required to see if metallicity becomes important for more extreme populations (e.g., in the Galactic Halo or thick disk).

%The mass-luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing need for both a higher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematics effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between M_Ks and M? spanning 0.70Msun to 0.075Msun.  The relation is derived from 61 nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with precision better than 1% in the best cases (median precision on Mtot of 5.6%). We use these binaries and resolved Ks magnitudes to calibrate the M_Ks-M? within a Monte Carlo Markov Chain framework. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine masses of single stars to 2-3%. The limit to this precision is scatter around the best-fit relation beyond measured $M_*$ uncertainties This may be due to intrinsic variation in the M_Ks-M? relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input parallaxes and/or orbital parameters. The effect of [Fe/H] on the M_Ks-M? relation is likely negligible for metallicities in the Solar neighborhood (3.8Â±2.1% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). The weak effect of [Fe/H] is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (at >4?). A sample of binaries with a wider range of abundances will be required to see if metallicity becomes important for more extreme populations.



\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Over the past decade, M dwarfs have become critical for a wide range of astrophysics. On the small scale, M dwarfs are attractive targets for the identification and characterization of exoplanets. The small size, low mass, and low luminosity of late-type stars facilitates the discovery of small planets \citep[e.g.][]{Muirhead2012,Martinez:2017aa,Mann:2018} and those in their circumstellar habitable zone \citep[e.g.,][]{Tarter2007,Shields:2016aa,Dittmann2017b}. Close-in, rocky planets are also significantly more common around M dwarfs than their Sun-like counterparts \citep{Dressing2013,2013PNAS..11019273P,Mulders2015,Gaidos2016b}

The properties of both the Milky Way and more distant galaxies are inexorably linked to parameters of their most numerous constituents \citep[$>$70\% of stars in the Solar neighborhood are M dwarfs,][]{Henry:1994fk,Reid:2004lr}. Late-type dwarfs weigh heavily on the Galactic mass function \citep[e.g.,][]{Covey:2008lr}, and are useful probes of the Milky Way's structure \citep[e.g.,][]{2008ApJ...673..864J,2017ApJ...843..141F}, kinematics \citep[e.g.,][]{2007AJ....134.2418B,2015RAA....15..860Y}, and chemical evolution \citep{Woolf:2012lr,2015AJ....149..140H}. Although K and M dwarfs are much fainter than their higher-mass counterparts, they measurably contribute to the integrated spectra of massive galaxies; thus M dwarf fundamental properties have become an essential component to studies of the initial mass function \citep[e.g.,][]{2012ApJ...747...69C,2016ApJ...821...39M} and mass-to-light ratio \citep{2015MNRAS.452L..21S} of nearby galaxies. M dwarf - white dwarf pairs are a plausible progenitor for Type Ia supernovae \citep{2012ApJ...758..123W}, and hence late-type stars are important to understand even for cosmological problems.

For all these areas, it is essential that we have a method to estimate the fundamental parameters of late-type dwarfs. For exoplanet research, this means stellar radii for planet radii in transit surveys, stellar masses for planet masses in radial velocity surveys, and both (stellar densities) for determining planet occurrence rates \citep[e.g.,][]{2010exop.book...55W,Gaidos2013}, internal structure \citep[e.g.,][]{Rogers:2011lr}, and habitability \citep[e.g.,][]{Gaidos2013a,Kane2017}. Spectra, photometry, and distances of stars provide a relatively direct means to measure \teff\ \citep[e.g.,][]{Rojas-Ayala:2012uq,Mann2013c}, luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{2002AJ....124.2721R}, metallicity \citep[e.g.,][]{Bonfils:2005,RojasAyala:2010}, and radius \citep[e.g., via Stefan-Boltzmann, ][]{Newton2015A,Kesseli:2018aa}. Masses are much more difficult to infer from observations alone, yet they are one of the most important and fundamental properties of a star.  

In the case of a binary, it is possible to directly determine the mass of a star from its orbital parameters. For systems with reasonably short orbital periods, this can be done by monitoring the motions of binary components.  Radial velocity variation can yield individual stellar masses but only modulo the sine of the orbital inclination \citep[e.g.,][]{Torres2002,Kraus2011,Stevens:2018aa}. In systems where binary components are spatially resolved, monitoring of their position angle and separation can yield a measurement of the total system mass, assuming the parallax is known \citep[e.g.,][]{Soderhjelm1999,Woi2003,2009ApJ...699..168D}. Absolute orbital astrometry (measured with respect to background stars) can yield both individual masses and a direct measurement of the system's parallax \citep[e.g.,][]{Koh2012,Benedict2016}. 

Microlensing can provide mass measurements for single stars \citep[e.g.,][]{2016ApJ...825...60Z,2017ApJ...838..154C,2017AJ....154..176S}. Unfortunately, this method cannot be used to target specific M dwarfs of interest, and detected microlensing events are both rare and primarily limited to distant ($\sim$Kpc) targets in crowded fields, where follow-up is difficult. 

Mass estimates of targeted single stars can be derived from evolutionary models \citep[e.g.,][]{Muirhead2012a}. However, differences between empirical and model-predicted mass-radius and radius-luminosity relations for late-type stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Boyajian2012,Feiden2012a} raise concerns about the reliability of model-based masses. Further, the masses derived depend on both the model grid used \citep{Spada2013,MIST1}, and the observed parameter over which the interpolation is done \citep[e.g., color versus luminosity,][]{Mann:2012,Mann2015b}. Ultimately, these models need to be tested empirically; differences between the models and empirical determinations can reveal important missing physics or erroneous assumptions in the model grids. 

An empirical approach to estimating single-star masses is through a relation between mass and luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{Hen1993, Delfosse2000}, calibrated with dynamical mass measurements from binary stars. Absolute magnitude can be used as a proxy for luminosity, and is generally easy to measure for visual binaries from the same data used to establish the orbit (resolved images/astrometry and a parallax). Deriving such relations for Sun-like stars is difficult, as the scatter is dominated by evolution \citep[e.g.,][]{1991A&ARv...3...91A,2010A&ARv..18...67T} leading to the need for a mass-luminosity-age relation. Because late-type stars evolve slowly on the main sequence, age becomes a negligible factor and the stellar locus in mass-luminosity space is tight for a fixed metallicity. Adopting near-infrared instead of optical magnitudes as a proxy for luminosity mitigates the effect of metallicity, as abundance variations have a weaker effect on the absolute flux levels of M dwarfs past 1.2\um\ when compared to optical regions \citep{Delfosse2000,Bonfils:2005}. Combined with the favorable Strehl ratios in adaptive optics imaging at $K$-band, this has made the $M_K-M_*$ relation the most precise and commonly used technique for estimated masses of late K and M dwarfs. 

Empirical $M_K-M_*$ relations from \citet{Hen1993} and \citet{Delfosse2000} provide mass determinations to $\simeq$10\% precision, with more recent improvements by \citet{Benedict2016}. However, as fields that rely on M dwarf parameters have pushed to higher precision, there has been increasing need for proportionate improvements in stellar mass precision. Further, since the advent of Gaia parallaxes, even late-type dwarfs beyond the Solar neighborhood now have $<1\%$ parallaxes, making uncertainty in the \mmk\ relation the primary source of uncertainty. Existing relations have gaps in their calibration sample, particularly below $0.1M_\odot$, where there is need for stellar masses to match new exoplanet surveys \citep[e.g.,][]{Gillon2017}. Methods to measure metallicities of M dwarfs have become increasingly precise \citep[e.g.,][]{RojasAyala:2010, 2014A&A...568A.121N}, and now extend to the end of the M-dwarf sequence \citep{Mann2014}, making it possible to explore the impact of metallicity on the \mmk\ relation. Most importantly, both existing models and empirical measurements of inactive M dwarfs have found tight ($<5$\% intrinsic scatter) relations for mass-radius \citep[e.g.,][]{Bayless2006,Spada2013,2017AJ....154..100H} and luminosity-radius \citep[e.g.,][]{Boyajian2012,2015ApJ...802L..10T,Mann2015b}, suggesting similar improvements in the \mmk\ relation are achievable. 

Here we present a revised empirical relation between $M_*$, $M_{K_S}$, and [Fe/H], spanning almost an order of magnitude in mass, from 0.075$M_\odot$ to 0.70$M_\odot$ covering $-0.6<$[Fe/H]$<+0.4$. The relation is built on orbital fits to visual binaries from a combination of adaptive optics imaging and astrometric measurements in the literature with metallicities estimated from the stars' near-infrared spectra. In Section~\ref{sec:targets} we detail our selection of nearby late-type binaries with orbits amenable to mass determinations. We overview our astrometric and spectroscopic observations in Section~\ref{sec:obs}, including those from telescope archives. We explain our procedure to computing separations and position angles, and incorporating similar measurements from the literature in Section~\ref{sec:astrometry}. Our orbit-fitting procedure is explained in Section~\ref{sec:orbit}. We describe our method to determine other parameters of each system ([Fe/H], distance, and \mks) in Section~\ref{sec:params}. Our technique to fit the \mmk\ relation from these binaries is described in Section~\ref{sec:relation}, including an analysis of the errors as a function of \mks, testing our relation on binaries with individual masses, a detailed look at the effects of [Fe/H], and a comparison to earlier similar mass-luminosity relations. We conclude in Section~\ref{sec:discussion} with a brief summary and a discussion of the important caveats and complications to consider when using our relation, as well as future directions we are taking to expand on the work given here.

 {\textit If you want to use the relations in this manuscript, we advise at least reading Section~\ref{sec:caveats} to understand the potential limitations of the provided program and posteriors\footnote{\href{https://github.com/awmann/M_-M_K-}{https://github.com/awmann/M\_-M\_K-}}.}%% Obviously I want you to read the whole paper, but let's be realistic here: it's >30 pages even without the tables.


\section{Sample Selection}\label{sec:targets}
Our selection of binaries was designed to sample the region of mass space over which the mass-luminosity relation should not evolve significantly between the zero-age main sequence and the age of the Galactic disk ($\sim$10~Gyr). We quantified this using the \citet{BHAC15} models, which we show in Figure~\ref{fig:age}. Above $0.70M_\odot$, a fixed luminosity (the observable) could correspond to a $\simeq$5\% range in masses over 1-10\, Gyr. Stars below $\simeq0.1M_\odot$ take a long time (100-1000\,Myr) to arrive on the main sequence, but obey a tight relation beyond this point. Those objects below $\simeq0.08M_\odot$ are predicted to never reach the main sequence and hence obey no mass-luminosity relation. However, this transition likely depends on metallicity, and empirical efforts studies have found a limit closer to 0.075$M_\odot$ \citep[e.g.,][]{Dieterich2014,Dupuy2017}. We therefore attempted to select systems spanning $0.075M_\odot \lesssim M_* \lesssim 0.70M_\odot$.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

We first selected systems by cross-matching catalogs of nearby M dwarfs \citep{Lepine:2013, Gaidos2014, 2014ApJ...784..156D,Winters2015}, with the fourth catalog of interferometric measurements of binary stars \citep[INT4,][]{Hartkopf:2001}, and adaptive optics (AO) images from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA). As part of this cross-match, we also included targets matching the M dwarf selection criteria of \citet{Gaidos2014}, but with a bluer color cut ($V-J>1.8$) to incorporate additional late-K dwarfs. We kept any binaries with separations less than 5\arcsec. We then added in other known late-type binaries from \citet{2008MNRAS.384..150L}, \citet{Jnn2012}, \citet{Jnn2014}, and \citet{Ward-Duong2015}. This provided a list of more than 300 multi-star systems.

From here we selected binaries for which we expect to be able to obtain a precise orbit on a reasonable (few year) timescale. We assumed that the average of available (literature) separation measurements approximate the semi-major axis of the system. Next we identified systems for which the time between the first available observation and our final observation would span at least 30\% of the orbit (based on our rough semi-major axis estimate), including the two years of our orbital monitoring program with Keck. This cut accounted for existing data. As a result, long-period binaries with extensive previous observations were included, depending on the baseline available, while those with only recent epochs would generally need to have orbits of $\ll$10 years to be targeted. After this cut we were left with 129 systems. Excluding 36 systems at $\delta<-30$\degree\ that are difficult to observe from Maunakea, 93 systems were included in our observing program.

We removed 16 systems from our analysis because of an unresolved tertiary (or quaternary) component noted in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{2010ApJ...720.1727L,2002A&A...382..118T,2018ApJS..235....6T}. In their current form, such systems were not useful for our analysis, as we had no $\Delta K$ magnitudes or mass ratios for the unresolved components. Since many of these are double- or triple-lined systems, it is possible to recover their parameters with multi-epoch radial velocities, and some systems have the necessary data in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{Sgr2000}. We continued to monitor these systems with high-resolution near-infrared spectrographs \citep{2010SPIE.7735E..1MY, 2012SPIE.8446E..2CR, Park2014}, but they were excluded from the analysis done here. High-order systems where all components are resolved (e.g., GJ 2005 ABC) were retained, although we only focus on the tighter pairs in this work. 

A total of 17 systems were flagged as young, i.e., affiliated with nearby young moving groups or clusters or with obvious signs of low gravity, high luminosity, or similar spectroscopic youth indicators \citep{Shkolnik2012, Kraus2014, Gagne2014, Malo2014a, Gagne2015, 2017AJ....153...95R, 2017AJ....154...69S, Rizzuto2017, 2018MNRAS.475.2955L}. We monitored these targets even after flagging them as young, but they were not included in the analysis for this paper. Many of these are likely pre-main-sequence stars and hence will not follow the same mass-luminosity relation. Even for those that are on the main-sequence, young M dwarfs may have higher luminosities for a given mass due to effects of activity and spots \citep[e.g.,][]{2015ApJ...807....3K,Stassun2012,Somers2017}. These young systems will be the subject of a future study into the effects of age and activity on the parameters of M dwarfs. 

After the completion of our observing program, we removed targets with fewer than six independent astrometric measurements and those lacking a precise parallax ($\sigma_{\pi}>7\%$). We attempted to fit orbits of the remaining 57 systems (Section~\ref{sec:orbit}). Three of the resulting orbital parameters yielded system masses for the system too imprecise ($>$20\% errors on $M_{tot}$) to be useful for our analysis. This left us with 54 binaries (108 stars).

We added in seven targets with orbits from \citet{Dupuy2017}, primarily to fill in the sample around the end of the M dwarf sequence. These seven were selected because they are theoretically massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion and satisfy all our other selection criteria. Systems from \citet{Dupuy2017} also had their orbits fit using a nearly identical method to our own, often using similar or identical sources of data and analysis methods (primarily Keck/NIRC2). Two additional systems in \citet{Dupuy2017} matched our initial cut, but were still omitted from this analysis. These were LP415-20, which \citet{Dupuy2017} suggest is an anomalous system and possibly an unresolved triple, and 2M1847+55, which has a relatively imprecise orbit compared to the rest of the sample.

Parameters of the final 61 systems included in our analysis are given in Table~\ref{tab:sample}.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction}\label{sec:obs} 

\subsection{Near-infrared Spectra with IRTF/SpeX}

To estimate the metallicities of our targets we obtained near-infrared spectra for 58 of 61 targets using the SpeX spectrograph \citep{Rayner:2003} on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) atop Maunakea. Observations were taken between May 2011 and November 2017. Most data were taken as part of programs to characterize the fundamental properties of nearby M dwarfs \citep[e.g.,][]{Mann2013c,Gaidos2014,Terrien2015}. All spectra were taken in SXD mode, providing simultaneous wavelength coverage from 0.9 to 2.5$\mu$m. For 56 of the targets, observations were taking using the 0.3$\times15\arcsec$ slit, which yielded a resolution of $R\simeq2000$. Spectra for two targets (2M2206-20 and 2M2140+16) were taken from \citet{2009ApJ...706..328D} and \citet{Dupuy2012}, which used the 0.5$\times15\arcsec$ and 0.8$\times15\arcsec$ slits (respectively), yielding spectral resolutions of $\simeq$750-1500. 

For Gl 65 and HD 239960 the SpeX slit was aligned to get spectra of both targets simultaneously. For all other targets the binary was unresolved or too poorly resolved to separate in the reduction procedure, and instead the slit was aligned with the parallactic angle. Each target was nodded between two positions along the slit to remove sky background. Depending on the target brightness and conditions, between 6 and 30 individual exposures were taken following this nodding pattern, with exposure times varying from 8s to 180s. An A0V-type star was observed immediately before or after each target to measure (and remove) telluric lines and flux calibrate the spectrum. The final stacked spectra had S/N of $>100$ per resolving element in the $K$-band for all but the four faintest targets (which had S/N$>50$). 

Basic data reduction was performed with {\tt SpeXTool} package \citep{Cushing2004}. This included flat fielding, sky subtraction, extraction of the one-dimensional spectrum, wavelength calibration, stacking of individual exposures, and merging of individual orders. Telluric lines were removed and the spectrum was flux calibrated using the A0V star observations and the {\tt xtellcor} software package \citep{Vacca2003}. When possible, the same A0V star was used for multiple targets taken near each other in time. 

Two of the three targets lacking SpeX spectra are too warm (earlier than K5) to derive a metallicity from NIR spectra (Gl 792.1 and Gl 765.2), and the third (Gl 54) is too far south to be observed with IRTF. 

\subsection{Adaptive Optics Imaging and Masking}\label{sec:ao}

We analyzed a mix of AO data from our own program with Keck/NIRC2 and archival imaging from the Keck II Telescope, the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and the Gemini North Telescope. In general we analyzed all usable images (e.g., non saturated, components resolved) regardless of observing mode and filter. 

For our analysis, we considered a single dataset a collection of observations with a unique combination of filter, target, and epoch. Each combined dataset consisted of a $\Delta m$ (for a given filter), separation, and position angle. 

We separate the observations and reduction by instrument/telescope below. The full list of astrometry and contrast measurements is given in Table~\ref{tab:astrom}, sorted by target and date. 

%% CHECK ALL  NUMBERS HERE!!
\subsubsection{Keck II/NIRC2 Imaging and Masking}
As part of a long-term monitoring program with Keck II atop Maunakea, between June 2015 and July 2018 we observed 51 of the 54 multiple-star systems fit in this paper. %% missing any Keck data are: Gl 54 (south), Gl 473 (not needed), Gl 765.2 (tons of data and pretty high-mass).
All observations were taken using the facility AO imager NIRC2 in the vertical angle mode (fixed angle relative to elevation axis) and the narrow camera ($\approx$10\,mas\,pixel$^{-1}$). Depending on target brightness and observing conditions, images were usually obtained through either the $K'$ ($\lambda_c=2.124$\um) or narrow $K_{\rm{cont}}$ ($\lambda_c=2.271$\um) filters, and non-redundant aperture masking (NRM) was always taken using the 9-hole mask and $K'$ filter. After acquiring the target and allowing the AO loops to close, we took four to 10 images or 6-8 interferograms (for NRM), adjusting coadds and integration time based on the brightness of the target. As most of our targets are bright, observations were usually taken using the Natural Guide Star (NGS) system \citep{2000PASP..112..315W,2004ApOpt..43.5458V}, only utilizing the Laser Guide Star (LGS) mode for the faintest ($R\gtrsim13$) targets or in poor conditions. In total, our observations provided 155 datasets.%%

In addition to our own data, we downloaded images from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA), spanning March 2002 to November 2015, all of which were taken with the NIRC2 imager. Archival data comprised a wide range of observing modes, filters, and cameras, although the majority was taken with the narrow camera and either the $H$- or $K$-band filter. We included nearly all data with clear detections of both binary components independent of the observing setup. We discarded saturated images, those taken with the coronagraph for either of the component stars, and where the target is completely unresolved. A total of 36 datasets were used from the archive. 

The same data reduction was applied to observations both from our own program and from the archive, following our custom procedure described in \citet{Kraus2016a}. To briefly summarize, we corrected for pixel value nonlinearity in each frame then dark- and flat-corrected it using calibrations taken the same night. In cases where no appropriate darks or flats were taken in the same night, we use a set from the nearest available night. We interpolated over ``dead'' and ``hot'' pixels, which were identified from superflats and superdarks built from data spanning 2006 to 2016. Because flats are rarely taken in narrowband filters, we used superflats built from the nearest (in wavelength) broadband filter where appropriate (e.g., for $K_{\rm{cont}}$ we used $K'$ flats). Pixels with flux levels $>10\sigma$ above the median of the eight adjacent pixels (primarily cosmic rays) were replaced with the median (average of the 4th and 5th ranked). Images were visually inspected as part of identifying the binary location, and a handful ($<$1\%) of images were negatively impacted by our cosmic ray removal (e.g., removal of part of the source). For these, we used the data prior to cosmic-ray rejections.

\subsubsection{CFHT/KIR Imaging}

We obtained data for 31 of our targets from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre archive, all taken with the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) using the Adaptive Optics Bonnette \citep[AOB, often referred to as PUEO after the Hawaiian owl,][]{1994SPIE.2201..833A} and the KIR infrared camera \citep{1998SPIE.3354..760D}. After removing bad observations (e.g., saturated, unresolved, or poor AO correction), a total of 233 datasets were included. Observations spanned December 1997 to January 2007, covering most of the time PUEO was in use at CFHT (1996 to 2011). Most observations were taken in a few-year period from 2000 to 2003. Observations spanned a range of filters across $JHK$ bands, but the majority used either the narrowband Br$\gamma$ or [FeII] filters. All observations used a 3-5 point dither pattern and took at least two images at each dither location. 

Data reduction for KIR observations followed the same basic steps as our NIRC2 data. We first applied flat-fielding and dark correction using a set of superflats and superdarks built by splitting the datasets into 6 month blocks and combining calibration data within the same time period. We identified bad pixels by median filtering stacks of science images taken of dozens of objects, which were then replaced with the median of the eight surrounding pixels. To identify cosmic rays, we first stacked consecutive images of each target (at a fixed location, so not including dithers), recording the robust mean and standard deviation at each pixel. Pixels $>10\sigma$ above this robust mean were replaced with the median of the eight surrounding points. Because KIR data were taken in sets of $>$5 images before the object was dithered, this median-filtering was effective for removing nearly all cosmic rays.


\subsubsection{VLT/NaCo Imaging}

We downloaded AO-corrected images from the ESO archive taken with the Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NAOS-CONICA, or NaCo) instrument on VLT. Data spanned November 2001 to October 2016, with about half of these 68 datasets taken from 2001 to 2005. Based on the program abstracts, $\lesssim$1/2 of the observations were meant to use these binaries as astrometric or photometric calibration (e.g., science case is unrelated to M dwarfs or binaries). Data covered 20 of our targets, excluding saturated or otherwise unusable data. Observations were taken with a wide range of filters, cameras, and observing patterns, but the majority were taken using the S13 camera ($\approx$13\,mas\,pixel$^{-1}$) with either broadband $K_s$ and $L$, or narrowband [FeII] and Br$\gamma$ filters, and always following a 2-4 point dither pattern. 

Basic data reduction was applied to NaCo images following a similar procedure with the KIR and NIRC2 data. We applied flat-fielding and dark corrections to each observation using the standard set of calibrations taken each night as part of the VLT queue. In the case where calibration (dark or flat) images were missing or unusable, we used the nearest (in time) set of calibration images matching the filter (for flats) and exposure setup (for darks). Flats taken in broadband filters were used for flat-fielding narrow-band images at similar wavelengths. We built bad pixel masks using median stacks of all images taken within a night after applying flat and dark corrections. To identify and remove cosmic rays we used the L.A. Cosmic software \citep{2001PASP..113.1420V}.


\subsubsection{Gemini/NIRI Imaging}
%% GJ 1081, LHS 221, LHS 6167, Gl 469, Gl 748, GJ 1245, Gl 900, Gl 791.2
We retrieved 36 datasets for 8 of our targets from the Gemini archive, all taken with the AO imager NIRI \citep{2003PASP..115.1388H} on the Frederick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope (Gemini North). All observations were taken between August 2008 and February 2011 with the assistance of the ALTtitude conjugate Adaptive optics for the InfraRed (ALTAIR). Most observations were taken with the f32 camera ($\approx$21\,mas\,pixel$^{-1}$) using broadband $J$-, $H$-, or $K$-band filters. All observations followed a 2-4 point dither pattern and took at least two images at each dither location. 

Data from NIRI were reduced using the same basic methods as for all other adaptive optics data. First, we applied flat and dark corrections to each set of images using the standard calibration images taken as part of the Gemini queue, usually within 24h of the target observations. In most cases, flats taken in broadband filters were used for narrowband flat-fielding. We then identified bad pixels from median filtering of all images within a given night. Observations with a target near or on top of a heavily impacted pixel (identified with the mask) were discarded. We used the L.A. Cosmic software for the identification and removal of cosmic rays. 

\section{Astrometry and photometry}\label{sec:astrometry}

Extracting separations and position angle measurements followed a similar multi-step procedure across all instruments, excluding the NRM data (which is described below). Our method is based largely on that described in \citet{2016ApJ...817...80D} and \citet{Dupuy2017}, which is built on the techniques from \citet{2008ApJ...689..436L} and \citet{2010ApJ...721.1725D}.

We first cross-correlated each image with a model Gaussian PSF to identify the most significant peaks. The cross-correlation peak occasionally centers on instrumental artifacts, often struggles to separate out partially overlapping binaries, and can easily identify the wrong source for triple systems. This step was checked by eye and updated as needed. The eye-check phase also allowed us to manually remove data of poor quality: e.g., no or poor AO correction, saturated data, or an unresolved system. We used these centers as the initial guess for the $x, y$ pixel position used in the next phase. 

We then fit the PSF centers by either: 1) running {\tt StarFinder}, a routine designed to measure astrometry and photometry from adaptive optics data by deriving a PSF template from the image and iteratively fitting this model to the components \citep[for more details, see][]{2000A&AS..147..335D}, or 2) fitting the binary image with a PSF modeled by three-component elliptical 2D Gaussians using the least-squares minimization routine {\tt MPFIT} \citep{Markwart2009}. Although the results of these two methods generally agreed, {\tt StarFinder} was preferred, as it used a non-parametric and more realistic model of the PSF and worked even with mediocre AO correction, provided the component PSFs were well separated. {\tt StarFinder}, however, failed on the tightest binaries, where it was unable to distinguish two stars and thus incorrectly built an extended PSF that fit the blended image. The Gaussian fit was used for these cases where {\tt StarFinder} failed. 

As part of the PSF fit, both methods provide a flux ratio of the PSF normalization factors, which we used to determine the contrast $\Delta m$ in the relevant band. Data from all filters are used for astrometry, although only measurements in the $K$-band ($K_s$, $K$, $K'$, $Br\gamma$, and $K_{\rm{cont}}$) were used in the estimate of \mks\ (see Section~\ref{sec:mags}).

PSF fitting provides pixel-position ($x$, $y$) measurements of each component, but converting these to separation ($\rho$) and position angle (PA) on the sky requires an astrometric calibration of the instrument. For the NIRC2 narrow camera, we used the \citet{Yelda2010} distortion solution for data taken before 2015 Apr 13 UT, and \citet{2016PASP..128i5004S} for data taken after this. These calibrations include a pixel scale and orientation determination of 9.952$\pm$0.002 mas\,pixel$^{-1}$ and $0.252\pm0.009^{\circ}$ for the former, and 9.971$\pm$0.004 mas\,pixel$^{-1}$ and $0.262\pm0.020^{\circ}$ for the latter. For the NIRC2 wide camera we used the solution from Fu et al. (2012, priv. comm.)\footnote{\href{http://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~haifu/idl/nirc2wide/}{http://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/$\sim$haifu/idl/nirc2wide/}}, with a pixel scale of $39.686\pm0.008$ mas\,pixel$^{-1}$ and the same orientation as the narrow camera. For the f/32 camera on NIRI, we used the distortion solution from the Gemini webpage\footnote{\href{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/undistort.pro}{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/undistort.pro}}. 

For other instruments and cameras, data were always taken following a dither pattern to sample different regions of the CCD distortion pattern. So the root-mean-square error (RMS) between dithered images should reflect errors due to uncorrected distortion (which is included in our errors; see below). For KIR (CFHT/PUEO), we adopted a pixel scale of 34.8$\pm$0.1 mas pixel$^{-1}$ \citep{2003ApJ...589..410S} and an orientation of $0\pm2$\degree \footnote{\href{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Detectors/IR/KIR/}{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Detectors/IR/KIR/}}. For NaCo, we assumed a pixel scale of 13.24$\pm0.05$ mas pixel$^{-1}$ for the S13 camera \citep{2003A&A...411..157M,2005A&A...435L..13N} and the values given in the ESO documentation for all others\footnote{\href{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/doc.html}{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/doc.html}} (with the same error). The rotation taken from the NaCo headers was assumed to be correct to 0.4$^{\circ}$ \citep{Sef2008}. For NIRI observations, we used a pixel scale provided in the Gemini documentation\footnote{\href{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/pixel-scales-fov-and-field-orientation}{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/pixel-scales-fov-and-field-orientation}} for each camera (117.1, 49.9, and 21.9 mas pixel$^{-1}$ for f/6, f/14, and f/32, respectively), with a global uncertainty of 0.05 mas pixel$^{-1}$ on the pixel scale and 0.1$^{\circ}$ on the orientation \citep{2004ApJ...614..235B}. 

Calculation of separations and position angles from non-redundant masking (NRM) observations followed the procedures in the appendix of \citet{Kraus2008} with the aid of the latest version of the ``Sydney'' aperture-masking interferometry code\footnote{\href{https://github.com/mikeireland/idlnrm}{https://github.com/mikeireland/idlnrm}}. To remove systematics, each NRM observation of a science star was paired with that of a single calibrator star taken in the same night with a similar magnitude and airmass. Binary system profiles were then fit to the closure phases to produce estimates of the separation, position angle, and contrast of the binary components. More details on the analysis of masking data can be found in \citet{2006ApJ...650L.131L}, \citet{Kraus2008}, and \citet{2012ApJ...744..120E}.

All data in a single set (same target, filter, and night) were combined into a single measurement (after applying all corrections above), with errors estimated using the RMS in the individual images within a night. This scatter across images was combined with the uncertainty in the orientation and pixel scale in quadrature. We assumed that the pixel scale and orientation uncertainties were completely correlated within a night and filter, so they do not decrease with repeat observations. 

We also corrected separation and position angle for differential atmospheric refraction \citep[DAR, ][]{2010SPIE.7736E..1IL} using filter wavelength information and weather data from the header (for VLT) or from the CFHT weather archive\footnote{\href{http://mkwc.ifa.hawaii.edu/archive/wx/cfht/}{http://mkwc.ifa.hawaii.edu/archive/wx/cfht/}} (for Keck, CFHT, and Gemini). We neglected the chromatic component of this effect as the correction is already small compared to measurement errors. 


\subsection{Literature Astrometry}\label{sec:litas}

We included measurements from the literature for 50 of the 54 systems analyzed here. % four targets with NO literature data are HIP9724 (Gl 84), Gl 263, Gl 416, Gl 494. 
To help identify sources of astrometry, we used the fourth catalog of interferometric observations of binary stars \citep[INT4,][]{Hartkopf:2001}. We only used measurements that included both a separation and position angle. In cases where the literature data was also available in one of the archives above (i.e., the same dataset used in the reference), we adopted our own measurements over the literature data. We did not utilize contrast measurements from the literature.

In total, we used 581 measurements (each including a separation and position angle) from 69 publications. The literature astrometry was distributed non-uniformly across our sample; roughly half of the points were for just 12 targets. In total, 160 points came from {\it HST}, primarily the Fine Guidance Sensors measurements of $\sim$10 binaries \citep[e.g.,][]{Benedict2016}. Approximately 180 measurements came from speckle observations on the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) 6m \citep[e.g.,][]{Bag2002}, WIYN \citep[e.g.,][]{Hor2017}, or SOAR \citep[][]{Tok2017} telescopes. The rest of the measurements are from a mix of surveys focusing on taking many epochs of specific systems to determine orbits \citep[e.g.,][]{Koh2012}, broader surveys (e.g., for multiplicity) that obtain 1-2 epochs on each of dozens of binaries \citep[e.g.,][]{Jnn2012}, and some targeting M dwarfs \citep[e.g.,][]{Mason2018}.

One complication using older literature astrometry is inhomogeneous reporting of separation and position angle errors. Many references provided measurements without errors at all, or have a discussion of general uncertainties, but do not provide them for individual measurements. Many sources reported measurement errors only, usually derived from a single set of observations of the target (e.g., scatter in the PSF fit, variations in separation and position angle between exposures, Poisson errors). However, since we combine measurements from multiple instruments and sources, it is critical that we also account for errors arising from field distortion, the adopted pixel scale and instrument orientation, and DAR \citep[e.g.,][]{2009AJ....137...83C}. These effects cannot be removed or modeled from individual epochs and can have a larger effect than measurement uncertainties alone, particularly for extremely high-precision measurements \citep[e.g.,][]{2009ApJ...690.1463L}.

The most robust corrections for field distortion and errors in the orientation and pixel scale of an instrument can be done by observing crowded fields at multiple dithers and orientations. The extracted positions of each star can be compared to an external catalog as well as to repeat measurements with the star on different parts of the detector. Similar methods have been used to calibrate many high-precision adaptive optics systems, including those used in this work \citep{Yelda2010, 2016PASP..128i5004S, 2015MNRAS.453.3234P}. In the absence of such data, observations of binaries with relatively well-determined orbits can be used as a low-order correction to the orientation or pixel scale \citep[e.g.,][]{Tok2015c}. Corrections from either set of observations are particularly effective for systems that are stabilized and rarely removed from the telescope. For many other instruments however, the corrections can vary with time. In such cases, it is better to model separation and position angle shifts as an extra error term, rather than attempt to model a time-dependent effect. This method, i.e., modeling errors from the detector/optics/etc. as an additional error term using binary orbits, is the strategy we adopted here.

We first identified a set of binaries where the orbit can be fit (with $<$5\% errors on the angular separation) without astrometry from a given reference. Literature sources using the same instrument and/or from the same paper series were merged for this comparison. We then fit the orbit of each binary following the method outlined in Section~\ref{sec:orbit}, using only the least-squares method for efficiency. We compared the expected position angle and separation (predicted from the binary orbit) to the measurements from the reference in question across all measurements and binaries included. For a given reference, we then had tens or hundreds of orbit residual points, from which we computed a reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2_\nu$) for both the separation and position angle, accounting for errors in the orbital parameters. For references with $\chi^2_\nu > 1$, we derived the required missing error term, i.e., the additional error in separation or position angle uncertainty required to yield $\chi^2_\nu = 1$. We show an example of the procedure in Figure~\ref{fig:literr}.

The rightmost panels show a histogram of separation and position angle residuals from measurements taken with the BTA 6-m across 39 different binaries. The total residuals are modeled well by a Gaussian function, which we use to estimate the missing error term after subtracting out reported measurement uncertainties and errors in the orbital parameters. }
\label{fig:literr}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

For references where no errors are provided, or for which there is a single uncertainty for all measurements, we adopted our value as the global uncertainty for all measurements. For references that do report uncertainties for each measurement, we added our value in quadrature with the reported value. The added errors are summarized reference group in Table~\ref{tab:litastrom}, and all literature astrometry used in this paper is listed alongside our own measurements in Table~\ref{tab:astrom}. 

Some earlier studies modeled the extra uncertainty in separation as a fraction \citep[e.g.,][]{Hrt2008,Hor2011,Tok2012d}. This is consistent with expectations for a plate scale errors, which impact wider binaries more than tighter systems. We found a better fit to separation residuals using a single value (the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:literr} shows one example). This may be because other effects, like DAR and field distortion, are as important as plate scale errors. However, because of the relatively narrow range of separations considered here, the two methods are similar for most sources, and our results were quite consistent with these earlier studies. \citet{2007AJ....134.1671M}, for example, compare the separation and position angle predictions from the ``Speckle Interferometry at USNO'' paper series to a set of well-characterized orbits and found a scatter of 1.1$^{\circ}$--1.2$^{\circ}$ in position angle and 2.2\%--5.6\% in separation. For our typical separation from this paper series ($\simeq1\arcsec$), this is consistent with our own determination of 1.2$^{\circ}$ and 37\,mas (Table~\ref{tab:litastrom}). To aid with such comparisons, we include the typical separation from each reference in the binary test sample in Table~\ref{tab:astrom}.

Because the assumed uncertainties of each reference may impact the orbital fit (and hence the residuals of another reference), this process was done over all references twice, each time adjusting the uncertainties as appropriate. References where we could not test the reported errors (e.g., due to insufficient data) and those with extremely large aded error terms ($>$100\,mas) were not used. No reference yielded a negative term. 

\subsection{Summary of input astrometry}

In total we measured or gathered 1109 unique datasets (unique filter/night/target combinations), approximately half of which we measured from adaptive optics images (528) and the other half were drawn from the literature (581). Most of the astrometry measurements derived from our analysis came from either NIRC2 (191) or KIR (233), with a smaller contribution from NaCo (68) and NIRI (36). 

Although they represent only $\simeq$20\% of the total astrometric measurements, the NIRC2 measurements are the most critical in constraining orbital parameters. NIRC2 astrometry was typically an order of magnitude more precise than those from the literature, and a factor of 3-8$\times$ more precise than those from KIR, NIRI, and NaCo (Figure~\ref{fig:errors}). We characterized the relative importance of each data source using the total number of unique separation measurements weighted by their uncertainties (1/$\sigma$). Under this metric, the NIRC2 points contributed significantly more orbital information than the literature data (77\% of the total weight from NIRC2 versus 9\% from the literature). Measurements from KIR (7\%) had a comparable total contribution to the literature data, each of which had $\simeq2-3\times$ the weight of measurements from NaCo (4\%) and NIRI (3\%). This comparison likely underestimated the importance of the NIRC2 data; literature and archive images tended to be concentrated on the best-characterized systems, while our NIRC2 observations were specifically coordinated to complete orbits and cover under- or un-sampled regions of binary orbits. The combination of NIRC2 and literature and/or KIR points is the most useful, since this provides both the precision and long baseline (KIR and NIRC2 data is typically separated by $>10$\,years) needed to fully constrain the orbital parameters.

Note that bins are spaced logarithmically to show the full range of separation uncertainties. }

\section{Orbit Fitting}\label{sec:orbit}

We fit the astrometry with the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) software {\tt emcee} \citep{Foreman-Mackey2013}, a Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler \citep{goodman2010}. For each system, we explored seven orbital elements: the orbital period ($P$), combined angular semi-major axis ($\alpha_{\rm{ang}}$), eccentricity ($e$), inclination ($i$), epoch of periastron passage ($T_0$), argument of periastron ($\omega$), and position angle of the line of nodes ($\Omega$). Parameters were limited by physical or definitional constraints, e.g., $P>0$, $0 \le e<1$, and $0\le i \le \pi$, but were given no additional boundaries. 

We applied non-uniform priors of 1/$P$, 1/$\alpha_{\rm{ang}}$, and $\sin(i)$ to $P$, $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}$, and $i$, respectively. All other parameters evolved under uniform priors. Walkers were initialized with the best-fit orbit determined using {\tt MPFIT} \citep{Markwart2009} and a spread in starting values based on the {\tt MPFIT} estimated errors. Each MCMC chain was initially run for $10^5$ steps with 100 walkers. 

We considered a chain converged if the total length was at least 50 times as long as the autocorrelation time \citep{2010CAMCS...5...65G}. Every chain was also examined by eye for convergence. Systems that did not converge were run for an additional $10^6$ total steps, which was sufficient for convergence for all systems. We saved every 100 steps in the chain, and the first 10\% of each chain was removed for burn-in. Longer burn-in time did not change the final posterior in any significant way, in part because the initial (least-squares) guesses were always near the final answer from the MCMC. 

Systems of near-equal mass may have the primary and companion confused, both in our own measurements and also those taken from the literature. We identified such measurements by eye during the {\tt MPFIT} stage and manually adjusted the position angles before starting the MCMC run. In total $\simeq$16 measurements were corrected this way, almost all of which were for three systems with contrast ratios close to unity. A more robust solution to this problem would be to feed a double-peaked prior at the reported value and $\pm$180\degree\ into the likelihood function. However, in all cases the problematic points were obvious by eye, had reported $\Delta m$ consistent with zero, and a simple 180\degree\ correction completely fixed the orbit. 

For a single system, GJ 1005, the position angle measurements from \citet{Benedict2016} differ significantly from our own astrometry and other literature measurements. The offset is consistent with a sign error in the $X$ or $Y$ positions assigned to each measurement before computing the final position angle. An earlier analysis of this same dataset by \citet{1998AJ....116.1440H} gave position angles consistent with ours and discrepant from \citet{Benedict2016}. We opt to use the \citet{Benedict2016} values over \citet{1998AJ....116.1440H} because the former is more precise, but we apply the relevant correction to the \citet{Benedict2016} position angles to correct the sign error. The separations were not affected, and no other system showed a similar discrepancy.

Dark grey lines are drawn by randomly sampling 50 orbit fits from the MCMC chain to display an estimate of the errors.

All orbits are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:a1}.}
\label{fig:orbits}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Overall the quality of the fits was extremely good, with $\chi^2_\nu$ values ranging from 0.1 to 2, and a mean cumulative probability (the probability of getting the $\chi^2$ or smaller given the degrees of freedom) of 44\% across all targets. We show some example orbital fits in Figure~\ref{fig:orbits} (with the full set in Appendix~\ref{sec:orbitplots}) and provide the median orbital parameters in Table~\ref{tab:orbits}. Orbits span a wide range in period; the tightest binaries have $P<1$\,yr, while the widest systems have periods of $>$50\,yr. The two systems with $P>50$\,yr (Gl 301 and Gl 277) were also some of the least-well characterized. No systems show evidence of period-doubling due to limited sampling, an advantage of using data with a mix of tight ($\lesssim$1\,year) and widely-spaced ($>5$\,years) astrometry.

Our orbital fits made heavy use of literature astrometry, many of which had no reported errors. Our method for assigning or correcting errors assumed that all measurements have a common missing error term per source (Section~\ref{sec:litas}). It is more likely that errors depend on the separation and contrast ratio, as well as quantities that were not consistently reported, like weather, setup, and observational strategy. Further, this technique assumed an uncorrelated error term. In the case of an erroneous pixel scale or imperfectly aligned instrument, all measurements from a common instrument err in the same direction. In practice, it is difficult to correct for these effects without access to the actual images. The data suggest this does not impact our results; the final $\chi^2_\nu$ values for the best-fit orbits shows no correlation with the fraction of astrometry from the literature versus our own measurements, and astrometry from our own measurements agrees well with the literature data. 

As an additional test, we tried refitting six binaries with the most literature data twice, first doubling the error term added to the literature points, then halving it. In all cases, overall parameters and errors did not change significantly (although the final $\chi^2_\nu$ values changed). The main reason for this is that our measurements (particularly those from NIRC2) are far more precise and hence dictate the final solution, even in cases where most of the individual measurements are from the literature. In the case of halving errors, the MCMC landed on a similar solution, but with smaller parameter uncertainties and increased $\chi^2$ values. We conclude this treatment of errors does not significantly impact our final orbital fits and that our assigned errors are reasonable overall.

\section{Stellar Parameters}\label{sec:params}

\subsection{Parallaxes}\label{sec:plx}

Parallaxes for 58 of the 61 systems were drawn from the literature. In general we adopted the most precise parallax determination, however, preference was given to determinations that either accounted for centroid motion of the binary, those with a baseline significantly different from the binary's orbital period, and measurements for a wide tertiary star with has a separate (mostly independent) parallax measurement we could adopt for the entire system. 

Many studies used the weighted mean of all available parallaxes \citep[e.g.,][]{Winters2015} to reduce overall uncertainties. However, nearly all systems have only a single precise parallax measurement. Gl 125, for example, has a parallax determination of 63.45$\pm$1.94\,mas from \citet{van-Leeuwen:2007yq}, and 77.2$\pm$11.6\,mas from \citet{van-Altena1995}. Using the weighted mean of these two yields 63.82$\pm$1.91\,mas, a negligible improvement from simply adopting the \citet{van-Leeuwen:2007yq} value. More importantly, the weighted mean is only applicable if the parallax measurements are independent. For binaries, even otherwise independent astrometry may be sampling the same systematics due to centroid motion of the unresolved binary. Thus we opt to use the most precise parallax for systems other than those in the special cases noted above.  

For 22 of the systems, we drew parallaxes from the new reduction of Hipparcos data \citep{van-Leeuwen:2007yq}. We used parallaxes from \citet{Dupuy2017} for the seven overlapping binaries, and from \citet{Benedict2016} for 13. For four systems we pulled parallaxes from the general catalogue of trigonometric parallaxes \citep{van-Altena1995}, and three were taken from the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution \citep[TGAS or Gaia DR1,][]{gaiadr1}.

About half (29) of our targets do not have entries in the second data release of Gaia \citep[DR2, ][]{GaiaDr2,Gaia-Collaboration:2018aa}. They were likely excluded because centroid shifts from orbital motion prevented a five-parameter (single-star) solution (a requirement to be included in DR2). We also found significant differences between the Gaia DR2 values and earlier measurements \citep[including from TGAS, ][]{2015A&A...574A.115M,gaiadr1} even when measurements were available. Many wide triples in Gaia DR2 (where the third star is several arc seconds away, and hence easily resolved) have significantly different parallaxes reported for the unresolved pair than for the wider companion. For example, GJ 2069A has a Gaia parallax of 60.237$\pm$0.080\,mas, while GJ 2069C has a Gaia parallax of 62.02$\pm$0.21\,mas, a difference of 1.8\,mas (7.9$\sigma$). Orbital motion is likely impacting the parallax values or uncertainties, an issue that should be resolved in future Gaia data releases that will include fits for orbital motion. We found no such issues with our other parallax sources. So we decided to not use Gaia DR2 parallaxes in most cases. 

We adopted Gaia DR2 parallaxes for four systems, GJ 1245AC, GJ 277AC, Gl 570BC, and HIP 111685AB, where we used the parallax of their wider common proper motion companion. In all cases the wider associated stars are not known to harbor another unresolved star, and hence they should not be impacted by the same binarity issue. GJ 570BC, Gl 695BC, GJ 2005BC, Gl 22AC, and 2M1047+40 also have nearby associated stars. %However, Gl 570A is extremely bright ($G\simeq5$) and hence may have an unreliable parallax due to saturation in DR2, 
However, GJ 2005A has no entries in Gaia DR2, the available parallaxes (from {\it HST} and Hipparcos) for Gl 695BC and Gl 22AC are similar or more precise than the those reported for Gl 695A and Gl 22B from Gaia DR2, and the wide companion to 2M1047+40 is itself a tight binary \citep[LP 213-67AB,][]{Dupuy2017} with a large reported excess astrometric noise in Gaia \citep[a sign of binarity,][]{2018RNAAS...2...20E}.

For three systems we derived new parallaxes using MEarth astrometry \citep{Nutzman:2008gf}. Updated parallaxes were measured following the procedure from \citet{2014ApJ...784..156D}. The only difference was we used a dataset with a baseline $\simeq$two years longer, which helps average out systematic errors arising from centroid motion due to the binary orbit, and significantly reduces the overall uncertainties. 

The remaining five systems had parallaxes from a range of other literature sources, each containing just one system in our sample. All adopted parallaxes and references are listed in Table~\ref{tab:sample}.


\subsection{Metallicity}\label{sec:feh}

We estimated [Fe/H] using our SpeX spectra and the empirical relations from \citet{Mann2013a} for K5-M6 dwarfs, and \citet{Mann2014} for M6-M9 dwarfs. These relations use a series of atomic lines (primarily Na, Ca, and K features) in the optical or NIR \citep[e.g.,][]{RojasAyala:2010,Terrien:2012lr}, empirically calibrated using wide binaries containing a solar-type primary and an M-dwarf companion \citep[e.g.,][]{Bonfils:2005,Johnson2009,Neves2012}. The calibrations were based on the assumption that components of such binaries have similar or identical metallicities \citep[e.g.,][]{2015ApJ...801L..10T}. Similar methods have been used extensively to assign metallicities across the M dwarf sequence \citep[e.g.,][]{Terrien2015,Muirhead2015,Dressing2017,2018ApJ...853...30V,2018ApJ...854..145M}. Final adopted [Fe/H] values are given in Table~\ref{tab:sample}. Errors account for Poisson noise in the spectrum, but because of the relatively high SNR of the spectra, final errors on [Fe/H] are generally dominated by the uncertainties in the calibration itself, conservatively estimated to be 0.08~dex \citep{Mann2013a,Mann2014}. However, we estimate that we can measure relative [Fe/H] values (one M dwarf compared to another) to 0.04~dex. 

For all but two systems (Gl 65 and HD 239960), our NIR spectra are for the combined flux of the binary components. \citet{Mann2014} explored the issue of measuring metallicities of binaries with unresolved data by combining spectra of single-stars with equal metallicities and re-applying the same calibration. The bias introduced is negligible ($\lesssim0.02$~dex) when compared to overall uncertainties. The added scatter is smaller than the measurement uncertainties, and can be explained entirely by Poisson noise introduced in the addition of component spectra. This may be more complicated for nearly or marginally resolved systems, where the narrow slit (0.3\arcsec) is preferentially including light from one star. However, repeating the tests of \citet{Mann2014} and adding a random flux weighting to the fainter star produced only a small increase in the uncertainties (0.01-0.03\,dex).

Two systems (2M2140+16, and 2M2206-20) have SpeX spectra taken with a wider slit, yielding lower spectral resolution. The bands in \citet{Mann2014} are defined using a homogeneous dataset taken with the narrow (0.3\arcsec) slit, so this difference may impact the derived [Fe/H]. We tested this by convolving a set of single-star SpeX spectra taken with the 0.3\arcsec\ slit with a Gaussian to put them at the appropriate lower resolution. The median of the derived [Fe/H] values changed by $<0.01$~dex, but the change varies between targets. Based on the resulting scatter, we estimate the errors on [Fe/H] from the lower-resolution spectra to be 0.12~dex on a Solar scale and 0.08~dex on a relative scale. These systems are marked separately in Table~\ref{tab:sample}. 

Two of the systems in our sample are L dwarfs (2M0746+20 and 2M1017+13). These are most likely above the hydrogen burning limit, and hence are included in our analysis. However, the \citet{Mann2014} method contains no L dwarf calibrators. Our derived [Fe/H] were extrapolations of the \citet{Mann2014} calibration. The \citet{Mann2014} calibration has only a weak dependence on spectral type, but we still advise treating the assigned values with skepticism until an L dwarf calibration becomes available. 

Two targets (Gl 792.1 and Gl 765.2) are too warm (earlier than K5) for the calibration of \citet{Mann2013a}. For these we take [Fe/H] values from \citet{2011A&A...530A.138C} and \citet{2010A&ARv..18...67T}, respectively. These [Fe/H] measurements are not necessarily on the same scale as those from \citet{Mann2013a}, which are calibrated against abundances of Sun-like stars from \citet{2015ApJ...805..126B,2016ApJS..225...32B}. Given reported variations in [Fe/H] for these stars, as well as [Fe/H] determination differences \citep{2014AJ....148...54H,2016ApJS..226....4H} we adopt conservative 0.08~dex uncertainties on both systems. For the other target lacking a SpeX spectrum (Gl 54), we derive [Fe/H] using the optical calibration of \citet{Mann2013a} and a moderate-resolution optical spectrum taken from \citet{Gaidos2014}.

\subsection{$K_S$-magnitudes} \label{sec:mags}

To determine $K_S$ magnitudes for each component we required both unresolved (total) $K_S$ for each system and the contrast ($\Delta K_S$) for each component. We adopted unresolved $K_S$ magnitudes from the Two Micron All Sky Survey \citep[2MASS,][]{Skrutskie2006}. Some of the brightest stars in our sample are near or beyond saturation in 2MASS. For these targets we recalculated $K_S$ magnitudes using available optical and NIR spectra, following the method of \citet{Mann2015a} and \citet{Mann2015b}, using available optical spectra from \citet{Gaidos2014}. Synthetic magnitudes were broadly consistent (mean difference of 0.003$\pm$0.002\,mag) with 2MASS $K_S$ magnitudes (and at similar precision) for fainter targets ($K_S>7$). We only updated $K_S$ magnitudes for bright systems where where our synthetic photometry differed from the 2MASS value by more than 2$\sigma$ (five systems). We mark these systems in Table~\ref{tab:sample}. 

Reddening and extinction are expected to be $\simeq$0 for all targets, as the most distant system is at 35\,pc, while the Local Bubble (a region of near-zero extinction) extends to $\simeq$70\,pc \citep{2009MNRAS.397.1286A}. So we did not apply any extinction correction to the adopted $K_S$ values.

To compute $\Delta K_S$, we used component contrast measurements from our adaptive optics data (Section~\ref{sec:astrometry}). We utilize any contrast taken with a filter centered in the $K$ band, which included $K_s$, $K$, and $K'$ ($K_p$ or $K$-prime), as well as narrowband filters $Br\gamma$ and $K_c$ ($K_{\rm{cont}}$ or $K$-continuum). While all targets considered here had at least one measurement in one of these filters, none of the response functions used was a perfect match to 2MASS $K_S$. We transformed each $K$-band contrast into 2MASS contrasts ($\Delta K_S$) using corrections derived from flux-calibrated spectra as detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:a1}. These corrections were generally small ($\lesssim0.1$ magnitudes).

After converting all contrast measurements to $\Delta K_S$, we combed multiple measurements using the robust weighted mean. Errors on contrasts for each dataset were taken to be the RMS in flux measurements among consecutive images. These errors may be underestimated because of imperfect PSF modeling, flat-fielding, uncorrected non-linearities in the detector, as well as intrinsic variability of the star. To test for this, we compared $\Delta K_X$ measurements of the same star using the same filter and instrument but on different nights (Figure~\ref{fig:magnitudes}). The comparison suggested a missing error term of 0.016\,magnitudes for NIRC2, 0.02 for KIR and NaCo, and 0.03 for NIRI. We did not split this into separate error terms per filter; many filters do not have enough multi-epoch data on their own, and a single error term across all filters for a given instrument gave a reasonable fit. We included this term as an additional error term common to all measurements in our final computation of $\Delta K_S$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{errors.eps}
\caption{Distribution of contrast ratio differences (in units of standard deviations) for data taken on the same target, and with the same filter and instrument, but in different nights. The red line is before adding the missing error term, while the blue line shows the distribution after adding this. The grey dashed line shows the expected Normal distribution. The histograms are offset slightly for clarity, although identical bins are used as input.}
\label{fig:magnitudes}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For GJ 2005BC and Gl 900BC, the 2MASS PSF includes flux from the A component. In both cases we use our AO data to measure $\Delta K_S$ between all three components. The total $K_S$ magnitude given in Table~\ref{tab:sample} already have the A component removed. 

\section{The Mass-Luminosity Relation}\label{sec:relation}

\subsection{Methodology}\label{sec:methods}

For main-sequence stars, the mass-luminosity relation traditionally takes the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ml}
\frac{L_*}{L_\odot} = C \left(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}\right)^\alpha,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ depends on the dominant energy transport mechanism (e.g., radiative versus convective) and internal structure of the star \citep{2004sipp.book.....H}. 

We rewrite Equation~\ref{eqn:ml} in terms of \mks\ instead of $L_*$. Absolute magnitudes are more easily measured than overall luminosity, and avoid introducing errors from uncertain bolometric corrections or the need to take flux-calibrated spectra in order to measure the bolometric flux directly. Switching to \mks\ also mitigates effects of abundance differences. The $K$-band is heavily dominated by metal-insensitive CO and H$_2$O molecular absorption bands. Optical bands are dominated by much stronger molecular bands (e.g. TiO, CO, CaH, MgH, and VO) that are sensitive to both [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:metal}, also see][]{Woolf:2006uq,Lepine:2007fk,Mann2013a}. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{metallicity_effect.eps}
\caption{Effect of changes in [M/H] on a model spectrum at \teff=3200\,K, $\log(g)=5$ in $g$- (left), $r$ (middle), and $K$-band (right). The top panel shows [M/H]=0 (black) and [M/H]=+0.5 (red) spectra from the CFIST BT-SETTL models \citep{2012RSPTA.370.2765A}. The bottom panel shows the ratio of the two, highlighting how small an effect [M/H] has in the $K$-band compared to optical regions. The one feature that stands out in the $K$-band is the Na doublet, which is a commonly used as a metallicity diagnostic for dwarfs \citep{RojasAyala:2010,Terrien:2012lr,Newton:2014}, and a gravity diagnostic for pre-main-sequence stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Schlieder2012}. }
\label{fig:metal}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Our sample encompassed almost an order of magnitude in mass and hence a range of underlying stellar physics. No single power law is expected to fit over the full sequence. Instead, we assumed that $\alpha$ depends on \mks, which we approximated as a polynomial. This yields a \mmk\ relation of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mmk}
\log \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i(M_{K_S}-zp)^i,
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ are the fit coefficients. The order of the fit ($n$) was determined using the Akaike Information Criterion \citep[AIC, ][]{Akaike1974}. The constant $zp$ is a zero-point (or anchor) magnitude, which we fixed at 7.5. This approximately corresponded to the logarithmic average mass of stars in our sample. The choice of zero-point is largely arbitrary and does not impact the final result. However, a value representative of the sample helps reduce the number of significant figures required for the $a_i$ values.

For the left hand side, we computed the total system mass ($M_{\rm{tot}}$) for each binary by combining the the orbital period ($P$) and total angular semi-major axis ($\alpha_{\rm{ang}}$) from our fits to the orbital parameters (Section~\ref{sec:orbit}) with the parallaxes ($\pi$, Section~\ref{sec:plx}), following a rewritten form of Kepler's laws:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mass}
M_{\rm{tot}} = M_{1}+M_{2} = \frac{(\alpha_{\rm{ang}}/\pi)^3}{P^2},
\end{equation}
where $P$ is in years, $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}$ and $\pi$ are in arcseconds, and $M_{\rm{tot}}$ is in Solar masses. 

Because Equation~\ref{eqn:mass} does not provide component/individual masses, when fitting for the $a_i$ coefficients we performed the comparison between the predicted and dynamical {\it total} mass for each system. For this, we rewrote Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk} in terms of total mass:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:mmk2}
M_{tot} &=& 10^{b_1} + 10^{b_2},\\
b_j &=& \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i(M_{K_S,j}-zp)^i, \label{eqn:mmk2_b}
\end{eqnarray}
where \mks$_{,1}$ and \mks$_{,2}$ are the primary and companion absolute $K$-band magnitudes, which were calculated from our measured $\Delta K_S$ and unresolved $K_S$ magnitudes (Section~\ref{sec:mags}). Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2} could easily be modified for higher-order star systems, providing individual \mks\ magnitudes and the total mass of the system are known. 

We fit for the $a_i$ terms in Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2} using the MCMC code {\tt emcee}, which accounts for the strong covariance between coefficients. Each coefficient was allowed to evolve under uniform priors without limits, and was initialized with the best-fit value derived from {\tt MPFIT}. We ran the MCMC chain with 600 walkers for $10^6$ steps after a burn-in of 50,000 steps. We ran separate MCMC chains testing values of $n$ (fit order) from three to seven. 

Errors on our dynamical masses are correlated to the errors on \mks. The system mass scales with the cube of the semi-major axis, which depends linearly with the parallax. As a result, the parallax was a major, if not the largest, source of uncertainty on the mass for most systems. Similarly, our $K_S$ magnitudes had relatively small errors (0.01-0.03\,mag), so \mks\ errors tended to be dominated by the parallax. Because this correlation is usually along (parallel to) the direction of the \mmk\ relation, it can tighten the fit if properly taken into account (when compared to assuming uncorrelated errors). 

We wanted the MCMC to explore the full ellipse representing the correlation between \mks\ and $M_*$ for each binary. In each step in the MCMC, we draw a parallax for each system from a Gaussian distribution defined by the parallax measurement and uncertainty (values in Table~\ref{tab:sample}) . The MCMC was provided $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}^3/P^2$ and $K_S$ (with uncertainties) for each system, from which total mass and \mks\ were recomputed using the drawn parallax. Then we compared the resulting dynamical and \mmk-predicted masses within the likelihood function. Thus the MCMC is forced to explore the range of possible parallaxes, allowing both the dynamical and model (from Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2}) to shift in a correlated way due to changes in the (shared) parallax. 

For computational efficiency, we assumed Gaussian errors on $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}^3/P^2$. Although $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}$ and $P$ were often correlated and non-Gaussian, posteriors of $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}^3/P^2$ were all well-described by a Gaussian (Figure~\ref{fig:correlated}). 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{LHS6167_corner.eps}
\caption{Example joint posterior on semi-major axis and orbital period (bottom left) for the system LHS 6167. Grey regions show 1, 2, and 3$\sigma$ (from darkest to lightest) of the points. The histograms above and to the right show the one-dimensional distributions of each parameter. The parameter fed into the \mmk\ fit is $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}^3/P^2$ (in arcsec$^3$ per year$^2$), which we show in the top right inset. }
\label{fig:correlated}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For main-sequence dwarfs at fixed metallicity, more massive stars should always be brighter. Thus we required that the resulting fit have a negative derivative (higher \mks\ always gives lower mass) over the full range of input objects considered. We tested running without this constraint, and found similar results over most of the parameter range considered. The major difference was near the edges of the input sample. Without the negative derivative constraint, the fit could become double valued where there were few points.

To handle any variation not included in our formalism, we fit for an additional dimensionless parameter $\sigma_e$. $\sigma_e$ can be interpreted as missing physics (e.g., age, detailed abundances, and/or activity/rotation) driving an intrinsic scatter in the \mmk, or as underestimated uncertainties in our input parallaxes or orbital parameters (and hence the final assigned mass). We implemented $\sigma_e$ as a fractional uncertainty in the total mass, added to the measurement uncertainty (from the orbit and parallax errors) in quadrature. We also tested included $\sigma_e$ as an additional uncertainty in the parallax, or in the assigned $K_S$-band magnitudes. We discuss the differences between these implementations in Section~\ref{sec:res}.

To briefly summarize each step of the MCMC chain:
\begin{itemize}
\item We assume a \mmk\ relation following Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk}. The first iteration uses seed guesses for the $a_i$ coefficients from a least-squared fit. 
\item We draw a parallax for each binary system from a Gaussian distribution determined by the literature parallaxes.
\item From the $\Delta K_S$, unresolved $K_S$ magnitudes, and parallaxes from the previous step we compute \mks\ for each of the 122 stars, as well as uncertainties arising from errors in the contrasts and unresolved magnitudes.
\item We apply the \mmk\ relation from the first step to compute 122 mass estimates.
\item We sum the component masses in each binary, providing predictions for the total masses of each of the 61 systems (with errors).
\item The uncertainties on each mass prediction are inflated by a fraction of the mass, $\sigma_e$, which was initialed to $\simeq$0. 
\item Using the input orbital parameters ($\alpha_{\rm{ang}}^3/P^2$) for each system and the parallax above, we compute a dynamical mass for each binary system. 
\item We compute the likelihood, which is the $\chi^2$ difference between all predicted total masses (from the relation) and total dynamical masses.
\item Based on the log-likelihood, {\tt emcee} adjusts the $a_i$ and $\sigma_e$ values and repeats the process.
\end{itemize}
We emphasize that the comparison was done completely in {\it total mass}; the fitting method included no assumptions about the mass ratio, nor were mass ratios needed to fit the $a_i$ coefficients or $\sigma_e$. 
%This was possible in part because that input sample was large and covered a wide range of $\Delta K_S$ values. For systems with $\Delta K_S <0.1$ any relation predicts similar masses for both components, so there is a narrow range of possible solutions that give the right total mass, and lack of knowledge of the mass ratio has a minor impact beyond reducing the total number of points constraining the fit. For stars with large mass ratios, one could find a large range of coefficients that reproduces thee total mass while failing to predict the correct individual masses. However, such solutions will fail on systems with similar total masses but different mass ratios because the individual \mks\ values will differ. The only exception is near the edge of the relation, where there may be only a few nearby targets to constrain the fit. However, in this scenario the MCMC will explore a wider range of solutions, and the increased error will be reflected in the scatter of $a_i$ coefficients or a larger $\sigma_e$. 

\subsection{Results and Uncertainties}\label{sec:res}

We show the resulting posteriors for the polynomial coefficients ($a_i$) in Figure~\ref{fig:fitpost}. The final fit was tightly constrained over the full sequence, which we show in Figure~\ref{fig:relation} for individual masses, and combined masses in Figure~\ref{fig:m_m}. For the former plot we have assumed a mass ratio for each system from the \mmk\ relation (i.e., the ratio of the two predicted masses given their measured \mks), since we do not use any mass ratios (or individual masses) in our MCMC fit (see Section~\ref{sec:methods}). These ratios are not used in the fit and have strongly correlated uncertainties given a common parallax and total $K_S$. They are only useful for displaying the relation. The latter Figure (Figure~\ref{fig:m_m}) is a more realistic representation of how the fit was done (in total mass).

To provide an estimate of the scatter in the relation as a function of mass, we show 100 randomly selected fits from the MCMC chain in grey.

Coefficients for powers of the same parity (even or odd) were strongly correlated to each other. This was expected, as a decrease in the slope (from linear) is best explained using an odd power, and increases with an even power. Coefficients for powers with even parity (with the exception of the $a_0$ term) were also generally centered around zero. This also was expected in the context of the shape of the relation seen in Figure~\ref{fig:relation}, and our requirement that the mass always decrease with decreasing luminosity (increasing \mks). A power with even parity will prefer to turn upwards at low masses. We explored this further by redoing the fit with no even powers ($a_0$ was retained), but exploring higher-order odd powers. The resulting fit was significantly worse, with a $\sigma_e$ value twice as large as fits with the same number of free parameters including even powers. The resulting fits also showed significant systematic deviations from the empirical data for $0.3M_\odot<M_*<0.5M_\odot$. We opted to include the even orders for all analyses despite their near-zero values. 

We adopted $n=\order$ as the preferred solution based both on the AIC values and visual inspection of the residuals. Lower-order fits did a reasonable job fitting most of the sequence, but poorly reproduced the masses of objects with $M_*<0.085M_\odot$. In this regime, the relation becomes increasingly non-linear. The result is that lower-order fits systematically overestimate the masses of the coolest objects in our sample (Figure~\ref{fig:order}) and tend to overestimate $\sigma_e$ to compensate. Higher-order fits explain the data reasonably well, but were not justified statistically (e.g., marginal decrease in $\sigma_e$) and showed slope changes outside the calibration sample that are not expected by theoretical considerations.

The systematic offset seen between the low-mass sample and the best-fit relation can be seen in the coefficient posteriors as well as the best-fit relation (i.e., the distribution of fits are systematically high). }

The three different implementations of $\sigma_e$ were broadly consistent with each other. For example, applying it as broadening on the parallax prior yielded an extra error $\gtrsim$1/3 that of implementing it on the final mass. Since the parallax term is cubed in the total mass calculation (Equation~\ref{eqn:mass}) these are functionally equivalent. However, we found that implementing $\sigma_e$ as an error on the total mass best explained the data. Taking $\sigma_e$ as an error on the $K_S$-band magnitude led to a $\chi^2_\nu$ value too low when just considering stars below 0.25$M_\odot$, and too high for stars above 0.5$M_\odot$, while applying $\chi^2_\nu$ as an error on the total mass yielded $\chi^2_\nu$ closer to one over the whole mass range. Taking $\sigma_e$ as an error on $M_*$ is also easily implemented when applying the relation. 

We list the best-fit (highest likelihood) coefficient values in Table~\ref{tab:coeff}, as well as the median value of $\sigma_e$. We also provide trimmed posteriors for each coefficient and $\sigma_e$ for our suggested relations. Fits using $n=4$ and $n=6$ are included in Table~\ref{tab:coeff} for reference, although we suggest using only the $n=\order$ relation. 

To estimate the uncertainty in the relation we computed the standard deviation in the derived masses for a fixed \mks\ across all MCMC steps, which we report in Table~\ref{tab:err}. In the best-constrained regions ($5\lesssim$\mks$\lesssim7$, $0.3\lesssim M_*\lesssim0.6$) the scatter in the relation is $\lesssim$1\%, reaching $\simeq$2\% near the edges. However, this underestimates the true uncertainty because of intrinsic scatter that cannot be explained by errors in the input masses, which we characterize by $\sigma_e$. For all fits, $\sigma_e$ was inconsistent with zero, suggesting a fundamental limit to our $M_*$ determinations. It is possible that $\sigma_e$ is purely a representation of missing uncertainties in the input parameters ($K_S$, $\pi$, or $\alpha_{\rm{ang}}^3/P^2$ values). However, even in this case, we cannot rule out the presence of intrinsic variation at the level of $\sigma_e$ without removing (or at least characterizing) the missing source(s) of error. So for a more realistic estimate of the final errors on the relation we performed the same uncertainty calculation using the fit posteriors, but also included $\sigma_e$ as a proxy of any intrinsic scatter in the relation. When accounting for this extra scatter the final uncertainty in the relation is $\simeq2\%$ over most of the fit, reaching $>3\%$ near the edges. 

To aid with using our relation and computing appropriate uncertainties, we included the fit posteriors and a simple code that provides output $M_*$ posteriors given a $K_S$, distance, and associated uncertainties. The program combines the scatter in the coefficients with the median value of $\sigma_e$ to produce a realistic $M_*$ posterior (including asymmetry). We note that while the relation is precise to 2-3\%, because of parallax and $K_S$ magnitude uncertainties output uncertainties from this code are usually 3-4\% even for stars with Gaia-precision distances. 
%A more robust account of errors than using Table~\ref{tab:err} would be to use the full coefficient posteriors to account for asymmetry around the best-fit relation (i.e., by sampling a range of possible $a_i$ values) as well as $\sigma_e$. Further, the uncertainties in Table~\ref{tab:err} only consider errors in the relation, errors in $K_S$ and distance need to be included separately. 


%Our method of fitting for any intrinsic scatter (through $\sigma_e$) will always give a final $\chi^2_\nu$ value near unity. 
As a test of our uncertainties, we also explored using a more traditional $\chi^2$ approach to estimate the relations intrinsic scatter. For this test, we adopted the best-fit (highest likelihood) coefficient parameters given in Table~\ref{tab:coeff} for $n=\order$ and no [Fe/H] term. We then applied the relation to each of the 122 component stars in our binary sample to compute an estimated mass, then sum the masses of each component to obtain total masses for each of the 61 binary systems. We compared this to the dynamical total masses, computing a $\chi^2_\nu$ value over all 61 systems. Our $\chi^2_\nu$ computation accounted errors in $K_S$ magnitudes, parallaxes, and orbital parameters, but ignored our earlier measurements of $\sigma_e$ (since this is what we are trying to measure). The final $\chi^2_\nu$ from this comparison was 1.58 (for 55 degrees of freedom). Adding a missing error term of 1.6\% in the output $M_*$ values from the relation yields $\chi^2_\nu \simeq 1$, somewhat smaller than our $\sigma_e$ estimate using a more robust MCMC analysis. The difference because the $\chi^2$ method fails to account for correlations between \mks\ and the dynamical mass determinations. Adopting a larger 5\% uncertainty yielded a $\chi^2_\nu=0.55$, with has a $<0.2\%$ chance of occurring given the number of degrees of freedom. This ruled out a significantly larger error on our fit and confirmed that our 2-3\% uncertainties are consistent with the data. 

Some systems land $>$10\% outside the relation in Figures~\ref{fig:relation} and \ref{fig:m_m}, however, all of these targets have similarly large ($>$10\%) uncertainties in their dynamical masses. If we restrict our sample to the 46 binaries with total mass uncertainties $<$10\%, the root-mean-square error (RMS) for the fit residuals is only 4.4\%. Similarly, the RMS is 2.5\% for the 26 binaries with $<$5\% mass uncertainties and 1.9\% the 12 systems  with $<2\%$ total mass uncertainties, again confirming our final 2-3\% precision estimates. 

 \subsection{Testing the relation for individual masses}\label{sec:test}
 In Section~\ref{sec:methods} we outlined the methodology and math for fitting the \mmk\ relation using only total system masses. However, since the relation is meant to be used on single stars, it is useful to test the relation on stars with dynamically-measured individual masses. Further, a comparison between our relation and literature mass determinations would be useful to assess our overall uncertainties. To this end, we utilized two samples of binaries with precisely determined {\it individual} masses from the literature, each of which are completely independent of our calibration sample: 1) astrometric binaries or triples with radial velocities or absolute astrometry not included in our binary sample and 2) M dwarf - M dwarf eclipsing binaries.
  
We drew (1) from \citet{Hen1993}, \citet{Delfosse2000}, and \citet{Benedict2016}, excluding those in our calibration sample (Section~\ref{sec:targets}). We added one target, GJ 2005A, for which the BC pair is is analyzed in this paper but there is a mass determination for the A component from \citet{Sef2008}. For (2), we drew eclipsing binaries from the compilations of \citet{Hartman2011} and \citet{Parsons2018}, restricting the sample to double-lined eclipsing binaries, those with individual mass estimates better than 5\%, and systems with a parallax from the second Gaia data release passing the Gaia quality cuts given in Appendix C of \citet{GaiaDr2}. We removed 19e-3-08413AB because the distance is too large ($\gg500\,$pc) to assume zero reddening, and excluded systems from \citet{Kraus2011} because they have no reported flux or luminosity ratios, which are needed to estimate $\Delta K_S$ (detailed below). Lastly, we removed PTFEB132+19AB \citep{2017ApJ...845...72K} because it is young ($\simeq$650\,Myr). In total this gives us individual masses for 29 stars with which to test our \mmk\ relation. 

A significant advantage of eclipsing binaries is that we could adopt the much more precise parallaxes from Gaia, as they all have orbits that are too tight to show significant centroid motion. For the astrometric binaries/triples, we drew parallaxes either from DR2 parallaxes of nearby companions (e.g., for Gl 644ABC we used the parallax form the wider companion Gl 643), or from sources that accounted for the high-order nature of the system. 

As with binaries analyzed in this paper, unresolved $K_S$ values were taken from 2MASS. We used adaptive optics data from VLT/NaCo to derive $\Delta K$ for Gl 866AC-B, and our own Keck/NIRC2 measurements for Gl 644A-BC and GJ 2005A-B-C (all three are resolved). For other systems, including unresolved components of the triples (Gl 866A-C and Gl 644B-C), the literature only provided contrast ratios in optical bands. We converted these to $\Delta K_S$ using the synthetic and observed magnitudes given in \citet{Mann2015b}, following a procedure analogous to that outlined in \citep{2017ApJ...845...72K}. To briefly summarize, we found the combination of two single-star spectral templates that reproduced both the unresolved spectral-energy distribution and the contrast for a given band, then computed a $\Delta K_S$ value for the best-fit template combination. This is similar to our conversion of $\Delta K_X$ to $\Delta K_S$ detailed in the Appendix. 

Correction from optical to NIR contrasts depends on metallicity \citep[e.g., ][]{Schlaufman2010} and precise metallicities of these systems were not known. Instead, we assumed all systems were $-0.6<$[Fe/H]$<+0.4$ and adopted uncertainties that encompass the range of values due to unknown metallicity. Errors introduced from these contrast conversions were extremely small for nearly equal-mass systems ($\Delta\,K_S\simeq0$), but became large ($>$0.1\,mag) for systems with mass ratios $\lesssim$0.6. 

Table~\ref{tab:ind} lists all systems with their adopted parallaxes, $M_*$ estimates, corresponding references, and our derived $K_S$ magnitudes.

We show the \mks\ values versus literature dynamical masses for these systems in Figure~\ref{fig:ind} compared to the prediction from our \mmk\ relation. Our result follows the literature individual masses extremely well, demonstrating that our use of total masses did not impact the final result. To quantify this and test our estimated uncertainties, we calculated a predicted mass for each star using the $n=5$ relation with no [Fe/H] term as given in Section~\ref{sec:res} and the \mks\ value from our the adopted $K_S$ magnitudes and parallaxes. This is exactly as the procedure would be applied to single stars in the field. The output masses account for uncertainty in the relation (including intrinsic scatter characterized by $\sigma_e$) as well as uncertainties in $K_S$ magnitudes and parallaxes. 

\begin{figure}[th]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{individual_mass.eps}
\caption{Top: $M_*$ and \mks\ for M dwarfs with individual dynamical masses from the literature (points) compared to our derived \mmk\ relation (dashed line). The grey region shows 100 randomly selected fits from the MCMC. Bottom: fractional difference between the empirical mass and the mass predicted by our \mmk\ relation. Points are color-coded by type (eclipsing or astrometric binaries). Errors in the bottom panel account for uncertainty in the \mmk\ relation as well as measurement uncertainties in $K_S$ magnitudes, parallaxes, and the literature dynamical masses. }
\label{fig:ind}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Of the 29 stars, only one had a literature mass $>2\sigma$ off from the \mmk\ predicted value (Kepler-16A), and the $\chi^2_\nu$ of predicted and dynamical masses was 1.06 ($\chi^2=30.8$). The RMS of the residuals was 3.6\%, although this is driven heavily by the points with the largest errors in $M_*$ or $K_S$. If we restrict the sample to targets with 3\% uncertainties in $M_*$ the RMS is only 2.6\%. This is consistent with our error estimates using our astrometric binary sample, confirming that our relation and assigned errors are reasonable.

Figure~\ref{fig:ind} also suggests a small ($\simeq$2\%) systematic offset, such that dynamical masses are preferentially larger than those predicted from the \mmk\ relation, particularly for the eclipsing binaries. This difference is comparable in size to $\sigma_e$, and hence is within our assigned systematic uncertainties (further verified by a $\chi^2_\nu$ near unity). The difference could be due to, for example, a $<1$\% systematic error in the parallaxes due to binary motion. 

Assuming the small offset between literature individual masses and the predictions by our \mmk\ relation is not due to random or systematic uncertainties, it is consistent with a scenario where low-mass eclipsing binaries are inflated compared to single-stars due to increased activity \citep[e.g.,][]{MacDonald2012, Feiden2013,Feiden2014a,Somers2017}. Higher activity levels may inhibit convection, increasing the radius and decreasing the fusion rate and hence overall luminosity at fixed mass, with an estimated difference of 1-3\% in the derived masses over $0.1M_\odot<M_*<0.6M_\odot$. We highlight that the offset is not currently significant and hence only suggestive of a activity-related issues, but future studies could make a significant improvement through direct measurements of $\Delta K_S$ from NIR eclipses. 

\subsection{The role of metallicity}\label{sec:metal}

We explored the the effects of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation using the Mesa Isochrones and Stellar Tracks \citep[MIST,][]{MIST0,MIST1} and an updated version of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database \citep[DSEP,][]{Dotter2008}. The updates to DSEP have been previously detailed in \citet{Feiden2013,Feiden2014a}, and \citet{Muirhead2014}, with additional information on the updates for low-mass stars in \citet{Mann2015b}. MIST models use ATLAS/SYNTHE model atmospheres \citep{2004astro.ph..5087C} with updated TiO opacities for late-type stars that should improve performance. DSEP uses PHOENIX \cite{Hauschildt1999,1999ApJ...525..871H} models, and have been used widely for studies of late-type dwarfs \citep[e.g.,][]{Boyajian2012,2015MNRAS.454..593B,Kesseli:2018aa}. While other model grids \citep[e.g.,YaPSI, PARSEC, Lyon][]{Spada2013,Chen2014,BHAC15} show similar agreement with empirical studies of low-mass stars, we leave a more detailed comparison between the full range of model grids and our empirical masses for future analysis, and we restrict our model comparison here to just effects from metallicity. 

We show the expected \mks\ tracks from MIST and DSEP for $-0.5<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ in Figure~\ref{fig:mk_metal} alongside our empirical determinations. MIST models do not extend below 0.1$M_\odot$, while DSEP goes down to 0.085$M_\odot$. For this comparison we assumed a fixed age of 5\,Gyr, although the choice of age from 1-10\,Gyr makes a negligible difference for the mass range shown (Figure~\ref{fig:age}). 

Note that metal-rich stars are expected to be {\it less luminous} for a fixed $M_*$, whereas the opposite trend is seen for a fixed \teff\ and most color selections. Higher metal abundance increases the opacity, causing the stellar radius to increase at a fixed $M_*$ and surface temperature to decrease. Decreasing surface temperature also decreases the core temperature because it shifts the star to a different adiabat, which reduces nuclear reaction rates and overall luminosity. The trend is weaker (or even reversed) in the $K$-band, because although the overall luminosity is lower at higher [Fe/H], most of the increases in opacity are the optical, causing a larger fraction of the total luminosity to escape at NIR wavelengths. This difference as a function of wavelength can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:metal}, where the metal-rich spectrum sits below the solar-metallicity one at optical wavelengths, but above it in the NIR. The MIST and DSEP models likely have some difference in their treatment of one or both of these competing effects, as the DSEP models show a reduced impact of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation as with decreasing stellar mass (likely because of increasing opacity in the optical with decreasing surface temperature), while MIST models show a similarly large impact over the full mass range considered here. 

Based on our dynamical masses, there is a is a slight trend for metal-rich stars above 0.4$M_\odot$ to land below the median sequence, as expected from both model grids. However, many metal-poor stars also land below the sequence, and there is no obvious trend below 0.4$M_\odot$. Further, the largest metal-rich outlier in the high-mass region (Gl 99) had a relatively poor mass determination (12\%), and is consistent with the solar-metallicity sequence. 

\begin{figure*}[htp]

\caption{\mks\ as a function of $M_*$ using MIST (left) and DSEP (right) tracks of different metallicities (dashed lines) compared to empirical mass determinations (points). Color-coding by metallicity is the same for the points and lines, and matches the color scale of Figure~\ref{fig:relation}. Due to the limits of the model grids, the plots cut at 0.1$M_\odot$ and 0.085$M_\odot$ for MIST and DSEP, respectively. The bottom panel shows the fractional residual between the model and empirical determinations. This model masses for the residuals were estimated by interpolating over the model grid using the [Fe/H] and \mks\ for a given target. }
\label{fig:mk_metal}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The residuals from our best-fit indicate a weak (or no) effect on the derived $M_*$ due to changes in [Fe/H], as we show in Figure~\ref{fig:metal_resid}. A Spearman's rank test yielded no significant correlation between the residuals and [Fe/H]. We tried resampling the measurements using their uncertainties, and $<$1\% of samples showed a significant correlation. We also repeated this test, but restricted to just the best-characterized systems ($<5\%$ precision on mass) and still found no significant trend with [Fe/H]. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{residual_metal7.eps}
\caption{Fractional difference between the orbital and predicted system mass as a function of metallicity of the system. The top panel contains all systems, while the bottom shows just those with $<$5\% uncertainties on $M_*$. Note the top and bottom panels have different Y-axis ranges. Points are color-coded by the masses of components, with the inner dot corresponding to the primary star's estimated mass, and the outer circle the companion's estimated mass. Error bars consider only input errors on total $M_*$.}
\label{fig:metal_resid}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Our sample is limited in its [Fe/H] range; 67\% of the targets are $-0.2<$[Fe/H]$<+0.2$ and only one target has [Fe/H]$<-0.5$. It is possible that our best-fit relation masked any [Fe/H] term by shifting the fit to match the typical metallicity of stars at a given \mks. We explored [Fe/H] effects in a more robust way by fitting for a term of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:mmk3}
M_{tot} &=& (1+f[\rm{Fe/H]})\times \left(10^{b_1} + 10^{b_2}\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $b_j$ is defined in Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2_b}. This form assumes that a linear change in [Fe/H] corresponds to a fractional change in $M_*$ (e.g., f=0.1 would correspond to a 10\% change in derived $M_*$ per dex change in [Fe/H] at a fixed \mks). This is generally consistent with the models over the metallicity range considered here (although it is predicted to become increasing non-linear for [FeH]$<-0.5$). Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3} also assumes a single $f$ over the whole mass range considered. While this is consistent with the predictions of MIST models, DSEP models show a tightening with decreasing mass (increasing \mks). However, our sample is too small and errors on [Fe/H] too large to justify adding a term that depends on both [Fe/H] and \mks. We leave higher-order tests for a future investigation with a broader range of metallicities. 

For the metallicity analysis, we excluded the two L dwarfs from the sample because their metallicities are less reliable (extrapolated from an M dwarf calibration). As with our fit to Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2}, we tested a range of values for $n$ (number of $a_i$ coefficients). Both targets also have masses below the limits of the model grids. Our MCMC fitting method was otherwise identical to that outlined in Section~\ref{sec:relation}. 

We show the output coefficient posteriors including $f$ in Figure~\ref{fig:fitpost_feh}. We list the corresponding best-fit coefficients in Table~\ref{tab:coeff} along with the median values of $\sigma_e$ and $f$. As with our fits neglecting any [Fe/H] terms, we found significantly better agreement with the lowest-mass objects in the sample using $n=\order$, although $n=4$ and $n=6$ are listed in Table~\ref{tab:coeff} for reference. 

\begin{figure*}[p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{output_8feh_eMass.pdf}
\caption{Same as Figure~\ref{fig:fitpost}, but for the fit following Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3}, i.e., including the [Fe/H] term, $f$. }
\label{fig:fitpost_feh}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

In agreement with our previous analyses, our derived $f$ value is consistent with zero (a 0.8$\pm$2.4\% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). This suggests our relation will work reasonably well even on more extreme metallicity samples. However, it is also possible that [Fe/H] is less important than abundances of elements that specifically impact the strength of molecular features in M dwarf spectra. Higher C/O, for example, suppresses available Oxygen for TiO formation, weakling a major source of opacity in the optical \citep[e.g., C, O, Ti,][]{2012ApJ...747L..27F,2015ApJ...804...40G,Veyette2016a}. This also might explain some of the extra scatter in the relation ($\sigma_e$) if there is sufficient variance of these abundances in the given sample. Testing this will require a means to determine more detailed abundances of M dwarfs \citep[e.g.,][]{Veyette2017}, and/or to add in subdwarf binaries or other systems with more extreme abundances to provide increased leverage on any metallicity effects. 

To compare to the models, we fit the MIST and DSEP grid points in the same manner as the empirical dataset following Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3}. Our binary sample is not uniformly spaced in [Fe/H] and \mks, so to ensure a fair comparison, we resample the model grid to match the binary sample. For every target we generate a model-predicted mass at fixed age (5\,Gyr), and alpha abundance (Solar) by linearly interpolating over \mks\ and [Fe/H] (using the assigned values for that target). We use the resulting (model-based) masses with the input \mks\ and [Fe/H] values to fit for a model $f$ value that can be compared to our empirical determination.

In Figure~\ref{fig:f} we show the posterior on $f$ from the model grids compared to that from the dynamical masses. MIST models predict a larger [Fe/H] effect then suggested by our binary sample, while DSEP predictions are quite consistent with our own. The difference between the two posteriors ($f_{\rm{model}}-f_{\rm{dynamical}}$) is inconsistent with zero at $5.1\sigma$ for MIST, while for DSEP the difference is only $1.6\sigma$. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{F_plot.eps}
\caption{Comparison of the posterior on $f$ (fractional change in $M_*$ per dex in metallicity for a fixed \mks; Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3}) predicted by the MIST models (black) and DSEP (blue) compared to that using our dynamical masses (red). The MIST models significantly overpredict the role of [Fe/H] on the relation, although our results are quite consistent with predictions from DSEP. There are an identical number of points in each posterior and the bin sizes are the same. }
\label{fig:f}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The discrepancy between MIST model masses and dynamical masses cannot be explained by $\sigma_e$. Whatever interpretation we apply to $\sigma_e$, it only amounts to a $\simeq$2\% variation in $M_*$ for a given \mks. The MIST models predict a metallicity effect of $\simeq0.17$ per dex, and since our sample covers about 1 dex in [Fe/H], this translates to an expected $\simeq$17\% variation in mass over the full sample, or 8\% if we just consider the majority of the targets. It is possible that $\sigma_e$ is being driven in part by erroneous assigned [Fe/H] (or underestimated errors on [Fe/H]) which would systematically decrease our derived $f$ value, but the effect is too small to reconcile with the MIST models. 

 The discrepancy between MIST and empirical estimates of the impact of [Fe/H] could be due to missing opacity/molecular lines in the atmospheric models. Recent comparison suggest atmospheric models reproduce optical and NIR spectra of M dwarfs to $\simeq$5\% \citep[e.g.,][]{Lepine:2013,Mann2013c}, with the exception of a few molecular features like CaOH, AlH, and NaH \citep{Rajpurohit:2013}. However, these tests have not been performed on the atmospheric models used for MIST isochrones. Missing opacity at optical wavelengths would strengthen the effect of [Fe/H] by underestimating the number of saturated features; if a line is saturated adding [Fe/H] cannot make it stronger, which serves to reduce the impact of [Fe/H]. The effect at NIR wavelengths would be weaker, since there are fewer molecular bands, but underestimated opacity in the optical shifts continuum levels in the NIR (and how those levels change with [Fe/H]). A problem with the input opacities is also consistent with the trend of growing discrepancy at the lowest masses, where molecular bands become increasingly important, and might explain the difference between MIST and DSEP predictions (as they use different atmosphere boundary conditions). 
 


\subsection{Comparison to previous relations}\label{sec:other}

\subsubsection{\citet{Hen1993}}

\citet{Hen1993} provided one of the first \mmkc\ available. Although the least precise (scatter of 15-20\% in mass), it covered a large mass range ($0.08M_\odot<M_*1M_\odot$). Most of the mass measurements used for the \citet{Hen1993} relation have since been improved, and most of the astrometric binaries in their sample are included in our sample, except those at the high-mass end ($>0.7M_\odot$). 

We show the comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:henry}. The \citet{Hen1993} relation is split into three sections by mass, as can be seen in the sharp change at $\simeq0.2M_\odot$ and $0.5M_\odot$. The scatter in masses from \citet{Hen1993} is large, with some points deviating from the fit by $>50\%$ in mass. However, the two relations track each other to within 10-20\% over the entire overlapping mass range, consistent with the 15-20\% uncertainties given by \citet{Hen1993}

The bottom panel shows the residual of the \citet{Hen1993} points compared to our relation. Note that some extreme outlier masses are not shown in the residual plot. }
\label{fig:henry}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\citet{Delfosse2000}}

\citet{Delfosse2000} provided one of the most commonly used \mmkc\ relations, covering $0.1M_\odot<M_*<0.6M_\odot$. Like our work, the calibration was built primarily on astrometric binaries. \citet{Delfosse2000} used a mix of individual (targets with radial velocities and/or absolute astrometry) and total masses, with the latter case converted to individual masses using models available at the time. Nearly all the targets in \citet{Delfosse2000} were included in our sample, with the exception of triple systems and eclipsing binaries, both of which we avoided because of the complexity of computing total masses in the first scenario and estimating \mks\ in the latter. Because of the sample overlap, consistency is expected. However, a comparison can be useful to see how past use of \citet{Delfosse2000} may change with our more precise results.

We show the comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:delfosse}, including the points used in the \citet{Delfosse2000} calibration as well as the two fit lines. Given errors often quoted for the \citet{Delfosse2000} relation (5-10\%), the two fits are in remarkable ($<$5\%) agreement over most of the mass range ($0.15M_\odot \lesssim M_* \lesssim 0.5M_\odot$). Only at the high-mass end do the two relations diverge by as much as 10\%, but \citet{Delfosse2000} had few calibrators in this regime. While the two relations are in excellent agreement, the relation presented here is a factor of 3-5$\times$ more precise over the whole mass regime.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\citet{Mann2015b}}

\citet{Mann2015b} built a catalog of 183 M dwarfs with precise \teff\ and $R_*$, calibrated against radii measurements from long-baseline optical interferometry \citep{Boyajian2012} and precision bolometric fluxes \citep[e.g.,][]{Mann2015a,2015MNRAS.447..846B}. Masses were computed for these stars by interpolating the parameters onto an updated version of the DSEP models as described in \citet{Feiden2013,Feiden2014} and \citet{Muirhead2014}. Although these masses were model-dependent, they accurately reproduced the mass-radius relation from low-mass eclipsing binaries. This suggested that the model-based masses were accurate to $\simeq$3\% or better, and motivated the development of a \mmk\ relation from the \citet{Mann2015b} sample. A comparison to our relation can be seen in part as a test on the updated DSEP models, in addition to the results given in \citet{Mann2015b}. 

We show our fit with uncertainties alongside \citet{Mann2015b}'s in Figure~\ref{fig:mann}. The two fits track each other extremely well, with a maximum divergence of $\simeq$5\%. Given the quoted 2-3\% uncertainties from \citet{Mann2015b} and similar errors in our relation, this difference is not significant. There is a hint of tension at above 0.6$M_\odot$ and around 0.2-0.3$M_\odot$ where the difference is the largest, but even here the offset is not statistically significant.

\subsubsection{\citet{Benedict2016}}
Like our work, the \citet{Benedict2016} relation was also based primarily on masses derived from M dwarf astrometric binaries. The \citet{Benedict2016} sample uses absolute astrometry from {\it HST} fine guidance sensors and radial velocities for a subset of systems. In addition to the precision provided by {\it HST}, this combination yields individual (component) masses, and, in many cases, independent constraints on parallaxes. So although our sample is larger and contains most of the targets in \citet{Benedict2016}, their analysis is not subject to some of the complications of our own. 

We compare our \mmk\ relation \citet{Benedict2016}'s in Figure~\ref{fig:benedict}. The two relations are in excellent agreement for $0.09M_\odot\lesssim M_* \lesssim 0.25M_\odot$. Below this regime, the \citet{Benedict2016} fit is effectively anchored by one star, GJ1245C, because the two other stars in this low-mass regime (GJ 2005B and C) have relatively large errors. GJ1245AC is in our sample, but we use a parallax from \citet{GaiaDr2} on GJ 1245B for this system, which places it $10\sigma$ (2.5\%) more distant than the parallax adopted by \citet{Benedict2016}. Our orbital parameters for this system are in excellent agreement with \citet{Benedict2016} if we adopt their distance, but the \citet{GaiaDr2} parallax makes the final parameters more consistent with our \mmk\ relation than when adopting the \citet{Benedict2016} parallax. Since the \citet{Benedict2016} distance accounted for the binarity of this system, the origin of the difference between these two parallaxes is unclear. If GJ 1245B is itself an unresolved binary, this could explain the discrepant parallax (although there is no evidence of this). If the \citet{Benedict2016} parallax is correct, this reduces the total mass to 0.189$\pm$0.001$M_\odot$, while the predicted mass is 0.207$M_\odot$ for the adjusted $M_K$ values (8.90 and 10.02 for the primary and companion, respectively). To reconcile the dynamical and predicted mass using the \citet{Benedict2016} parallax, we would need to explain why GJ 1245AC is $\simeq$0.3~mag more luminous than predicted by other similar-mass objects, such as youth.

 Above 0.3$M_\odot$, \citet{Benedict2016} predicts masses as much as 10\% higher than our own for a fixed \mks. Our fit agrees reasonably well with the astrometric binaries fit by \citet{Benedict2016} in this mass regime. The divergence is driven instead by literature mass determinations that \citet{Benedict2016} included in their \mmk\ fit. Inspection of these literature points makes the origin of the discrepancy more clear: many are eclipsing binaries and have $\Delta K$-band magnitudes of mixed quality and/or lack parallaxes needed for a precise \mks. GU Boo, for example, has absolute magnitudes estimated from an optical eclipse depth combined with bolometric corrections \citep{Lopez2005}, which are drawn from models that perform poorly on M dwarfs \citep{1998A&AS..130...65L,Hauschildt1999}. Similarly, for GJ 2069 AC (CU Cnc) \citet{Benedict2016} adopted \mks\ from \citet{Ribas2003} that disagrees with the 2MASS $K_S$ and Gaia DR2 parallax (for either AC or B) using any $\Delta K_S$.

\section{Conclusions \& Discussion}\label{sec:discussion} 

\subsection{Summary}
 %The \mmk\ relation has been particularly useful because $K$-band magnitudes are widely available through 2MASS and other sources, extinction is usually negligible for nearby stars at these wavelengths, many adaptive optics systems perform well (better Strehl) at $K$-band, and the impact of metallicity on the mass-luminosity relation is smaller in $K$ than at optical wavelengths. 
%With the arrival of Gaia parallaxes combined with existing 2MASS photometry, nearly all early M-dwarfs out to $\simeq$100\,pc and late M-dwarfs out to $\simeq$50\,pc have precise ($\lesssim1\%$) parallaxes and \mks\ magnitudes, making scatter in existing \mmk\ relations the dominant source of uncertainty. 

The mass-luminosity relation has proven to be a critical tool for estimating masses of cool stars for decades, and has broad applications ranging from characterizing extrasolar planets to measuring the initial mass function in massive galaxies. We endeavored to improve on existing \mmk\ relations and evaluate the role of [Fe/H] on the relation by expanding the sample of calibrators and using new techniques to measure the metallicity of binary M dwarfs. As part of this effort, we have been monitoring a set of nearby late K and M dwarf visual binaries using adaptive optics imaging with the goal of mapping their orbits and estimating their masses. We combined these data with similar data from Keck, CFHT, Gemini, and VLT archives, as well as astrometric measurements from the literature. The combination of literature astrometry and the recent Keck measurements were particularly important to provide the required baseline to fit long-period ($P>10$ years) orbits. 

We used these astrometric data to fit the orbits for 54 binaries, which we joined with parallaxes from the literature or derived from MEarth astrometry to determine the total masses of each system. We combined this with seven ultracool binaries from \citep{Dupuy2017}, which were analyzed in a nearly identical way to the procedure used in this paper and provided additional coverage near the hydrogen burning limit. Five binaries in our final sample of 61 systems had total mass determinations better than 1\%, 12 to better than 2\%, and 26 to better than 5\%. 

We used our dynamical masses and resolved \mks\ magnitudes to fit for an empirical relation between $M_*$ and \mks. Our methodology uses the observed quantity, which is the {\it total} mass of a given binary. While this halves the number points constraining the fit compared to using individual masses, using $M_{\rm{tot}}$ is far more robust than using model-based mass ratios, reduces the need for observationally expensive radial velocity and/or absolute astrometry (difficult without {\it HST} for many systems), and helps increase the range of binaries amenable to characterization (e.g., wider systems with small radial velocity amplitudes). 

The resulting \mmk\ relation covers almost an order of magnitude in $M_*$, from $\simeq0.70M\odot$ down to the hydrogen burning limit ($\simeq0.075M_\odot$) and includes stars spanning the range of [Fe/H] expected for the Solar neighborhood ($-0.6<$[Fe/H]$<+0.4$). Output masses from our \mmk\ relation are precise to $\simeq$2\% over most of the M dwarf sequence, rising to $\simeq3\%$ near the edges of the relation. 

The $\simeq$2\% uncertainty is limited primarily by scatter in the input masses around the best-fit above what is expected given their assigned mass uncertainties. We characterize this scatter with a free parameter ($\sigma_e$), which we found to be $\lesssim$2\% for all fits. It is unclear if $\sigma_e$ arose from intrinsic variation in the \mmk\ relation due to a missing astrophysical parameter, such as age/activity/rotation \citep[e.g.,][]{Kraus2011,Feiden:2016aa,Somers2017} or detailed abundances \citep[e.g.,][]{2017A&A...604A..97L,Veyette2017}, or if $\sigma_e$ represents underestimated errors in the input orbital parameters, parallaxes, or $K_S$ magnitudes. %Our adopted parallaxes are likely a contributor, as some may have their uncertainties underestimated due to uncorrected orbital motion in the input astrometry. %This does not impact many targets, which had parallaxes drawn from a wide proper motion companion or measured accounting for orbital motion simultaneously. However, it is possible that the missing error is larger in magnitude, but only applies to a subset of the targets, or originates from a mix of intrinsic variation and underestimated errors. 

As a test of our relation, we compared \mmk-predicted masses to individual dynamical masses, independent of our own sample, drawn from the literature. Our \mmk\ provides mass estimates in excellent agreement with those from the literature, with a $\chi^2_\nu$ of 1.06 and a scatter consistent with measurement uncertainties. This validates that our method of using total masses to constrain a relation meant for single stars did not bias our result and that our assigned precision is reasonable. There is a small ($\lesssim$2\%) systematic offset between the literature eclipsing binaries and predictions from our own relation. Although it is suggestive of activity-related issues, this is within our relation uncertainties, and hence is not significant.

Using empirically calibrated spectroscopic abundances, we explored the role of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation. Our results indicate the effect of metallicity on the \mmk\ relation is consistent with zero. MIST models significantly overestimate the importance of [Fe/H] in the \mmk\ relation (at $5\sigma$), however predictions from updated DSEP models are consistent with our own. %DSEP also predicts the impact of [Fe/H] will tighten (and even reverse) with decreasing $M_*$ (increasing \mks), which is consistent with the trend seen in our own sample. Future studies with a wider range of metallicities will be useful to confirm this tightening predicted by DSEP models. 

%Separate from the relative effects of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation, both model grids tested systematically underestimate $M_*$ (at fixed \mks) for stars below 0.5$M_\odot$. For stars with $0.1M_\odot<M_*<0.5M_\odot$, the difference is significant for both model grids, but the offset is larger when using MIST models ($4.1\pm0.6\%$) than for DSEP ($2.7\pm0.6\%$). 

We compared our relation to recent similar relations in the literature. Given quoted uncertainties, both the \citet{Delfosse2000} and \citet{Mann2015b} relations agreed with our own over the full sequence. Our results were consistent with the sample of astrometric binaries analyzed in \citet{Benedict2016}, but our relation diverges from \citet{Benedict2016} above $\simeq0.35M_\odot$. We attribute this difference to literature points included in the \citet{Benedict2016} fit from earlier analyses with uncertain distances and $\Delta K_S$ magnitudes. %Increasing availability of Gaia parallaxes for these systems as well as ongoing efforts to measure their eclipses in range of wavelengths \citep[e.g.,][]{2017AJ....154..100H} should significantly improve their utility for studying the mass-luminosity relation of M dwarfs.

Earlier work on the mass-luminosity relation did not explore missing errors or intrinsic scatter (i.e., $\sigma_e$) in the relation, although it does appear to be present. \citet{Benedict2016}, for example, achieved a $\chi^2$ on their adopted \mmk\ relation of 384 for 40 degrees of freedom. This may explain some of the differences between our results and that of \citet{Benedict2016} on the high-mass end, where a few mass determinations with small assigned errors may be dominating the fit. 

\subsection{Suggestions when using our \mmk\ relation}\label{sec:caveats}

To help users interested in using \mks\ to compute a realistic $M_*$ and $\sigma_{M_*}$ of single stars with parallaxes and $K_S$ magnitudes, we provide a simple code\footnote{\href{https://github.com/awmann/M_-M_K-}{https://github.com/awmann/M\_-M\_K-}} to sample the fit posterior. {\bf Before using that code or the provided MCMC posteriors, take note of the following suggestions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The fit behaves poorly near the edges of the calibration sample. The scatter in the MCMC posterior accounts for this, but restrict use to $4.0<M_{K_S}<11.0$ ($0.075M_\odot<M_*<0.74M_\odot$), and a `safe' range would be $4.5<M_{K_S}<10.5$ ($0.08M_\odot<M_*<0.67M_\odot$). 

\item Our relation is only valid for main-sequence stars, and the roles of youth and activity were not accounted for in our analysis. The comparison to masses from eclipsing binaries also suggests issues for highly active stars. Based on the Lyon models \citep{BHAC15}, we advise restricting use to $>$100\,Myr above $0.4M_\odot$, $>$300\,Myr to $0.2M_\odot$, $>$500\,Myr to $0.1M_\odot$, and $>1$\,Gyr below 0.1$M_\odot$. A safer cut would be to only use this on stars $>$1 Gyr, similar to the calibration sample.

\item The sample metallicity spans $-0.60<\rm{[Fe/H]}<+0.45$, but 85\% of the binaries have $-0.40<\rm{[Fe/H]}<+0.30$. We provide a fit that attempts to take into account changes due to [Fe/H], but the effect is not significant. This suggests the [Fe/H]-free relation is safe to use over the range of metallicities expected in the Solar neighborhood (similar to the calibration sample). We especially advise using the [Fe/H]-free relation for stars with \mks$>6.5$, given both the behavior of our fit and the predictions from DSEP (Figure~\ref{fig:mk_metal}b). However, given the paucity of extreme metallicity systems in our calibration sample, we advise caution when targeting more metal-poor populations. The effects of more detailed abundances (e.g., [$\alpha$/Fe]) are completely untested.

\item The relation is only tested above the hydrogen burning limit. Since the boundary likely depends on metallicity \citep{2001RvMP...73..719B}, it is also not possible to use a simple $M_{K_S}$ cut even if the target is known to be old. Objects just below the hydrogen burning limit age slowly \citep{BHAC15}, so the relation given here may give reasonable results for many of these, but we urge caution when interpreting $M_*$ values for $M_{K_S}>10.5$. 

\item Since the origin of the $\sigma_e$ value is unclear, we suggest always including this as an irreducible and systematic source of error when estimating the mass of a target. 

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Future directions}

We intentionally selected targets that had $\Delta K$ measurements, as \mks\ was known to give the tightest relation with $M_*$ for M dwarfs. Unfortunately, only about 1/3 of the sample have measurements in an optical band. This limits the utility of the sample, as Gaia $G$, $BP$, and $RP$ are now widely available for early and mid-M dwarfs, and are generally measured with better precision than 2MASS $K_S$. The growing capabilities of speckle cameras \citep[e.g.,][]{2009AJ....137.5057H} offer the opportunity to add optical contrasts. These can be converted to Gaia bandpasses, given reasonable assumptions about the component spectra, and used to derive a $M_{G}-M_*$ (or $M_G-M_*$-[Fe/H]) relation that can be applied to millions of K and M dwarfs. Complementary optical data also provide colors for individual components, from which we can measure component \teff\ and luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{2017ApJ...845...72K}.

We would like to explore changes in the impact of [Fe/H] as a function of \mks or $M_*$, especially given predictions from the DSEP models (Figure~\ref{fig:mk_metal}b). Our sample was heavily biased towards the narrow [Fe/H] distribution of nearby stars. This limited both our ability to explore more complex impacts of [Fe/H] and tighten constraints on $f$. We identified five additional [Fe/H]$<-0.5$ systems not included in our analysis, including two subdwarf binaries. However all of these systems had short baselines in the literature compared to their expected orbital periods, and complete orbits will take several more years. The availability of Gaia parallaxes will also help improve the precision of the known metal-poor systems and aid in the identification of new ones. Lastly, as new methods arrive to measure detailed abundances of M dwarfs \citep{Veyette2016a,Veyette2017} we can explore effects beyond just [Fe/H]. %This is especially useful for systems with large enough radial velocity differences between component stars to separate out individual spectra at high resolution.

Mass ratios were available for some systems  \citep[e.g.,][]{Soderhjelm1999,Mlg2007b,Dupuy2017}. However, these determinations were heterogeneous (e.g., some use models, some radial velocities), and some mass ratios reported in the literature are derived from orbits that disagree with our own determinations \citep[e.g.,][]{Koh2012}. A more robust method would be to include radial velocity or absolute astrometry as part of our larger analysis. Fortunately, later Gaia data releases will include full absolute astrometry. When combined with a measure of the flux ratio in the Gaia $G$ bandpass (a few systems are resolved in Gaia) and our existing astrometry, we will be able to fit for both individual masses and each system's parallax. The resulting dataset will effectively double our sample size, and will help reveal the origin of $\sigma_e$. 

%The presence of unresolved tight companions (triples or quadruples) could bias the overall relation. A close-in third star orbiting one of the two binary components might be stable, and would not have been detected in our AO data. An unresolved, less massive companion would drive the total mass of the system higher, but has a much smaller effect on the total luminosity. So unresolved triples will sit {\it low} in Figure~\ref{fig:relation} (higher mass for a fixed \mks). A few stars do sit well below the fit, but not more so than expected given their mass uncertainties. Many of our targets have some radial velocity data in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{1999A&A...344..897D,Raghavan2010,Benedict2016}, which rule out the presence of any unresolved stellar companion. However, a more detailed analysis will require re-analysis of the radial velocity data to determine the maximum mass of an undetected companion for each individual system and convert that into a bias on the relation. 

Ages of our binary sample are not known, preventing any study into the effects of age on the \mmk\ relation. However, our larger sample of binaries with orbit measurements still in progress contains known members of nearby young moving groups and the Hyades cluster. Many of these have complete or nearly complete orbital solutions, and will soon provide a powerful set of mass benchmarks with known ages. These systems span ages from 10-650\,Myr, offering the chance to both test pre-main-sequence models of M dwarfs \citep{2015ApJ...813L..11M,2016ApJ...817..164R,2016ApJ...818..156C,2016AJ....152..175N} and explore the role of activity on M dwarf parameters \citep[e.g.,][]{Spada2013,Kesseli:2018aa}. The current sample can be included in such work when combined with age indicators like kinematics \citep{2018MNRAS.tmp..966W}, ultraviolet flux \citep{Ansdell2015}, and rotation periods expected from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \citep[{\it TESS},][]{2014SPIE.9143E..20R}.

\section{Converting Observed $\Delta K_X$ to 2MASS $\Delta K_S$ for M dwarfs} \label{sec:a1}
To place all $K$-band magnitudes on the 2MASS system, we derived a relation between $\Delta K_X$ and $\Delta K_S$ as a function of $\Delta K_X$, where $X$ denotes the particular filter (e.g., $K_{\rm{cont}}$, $K'$) used for the AO observations. For photometry, we only used observations taken with a filter somewhere in the $K$-band (all wavelengths are used for astrometry), which included observations with the narrow Bracket-Gamma filter. 

To derive a conversion between contrasts, we used the 183 absolutely-flux calibrated spectra of nearby single stars from \citet{Mann2015b}, which cover a similar range of \teff\ and $M_*$ as the sample considered here. These spectra are mostly empirical; models are only used to fill in gaps in the spectrum or regions of high telluric contamination, none of which land in the regions covered by the filters considered here.

First we randomly sampled two stars from the sample and scaled the absolute level of each spectrum by the star's distance (effectively placing both at 1\,pc). We convolved each of the two stars with the relevant filter profiles for NIRC2\footnote{\href{https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/filters.html}{https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/filters.html}}, KIR\footnote{\href{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Filters/kir.html}{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Filters/kir.html}}, NIRI\footnote{\href{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/filters}{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/filters}}, and NaCo\footnote{\href{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/inst/filters.html}{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/inst/filters.html}}, and integrate over the wavelength range of the filters to compute the flux ($F$) in a given band. We used a filter profile for 2MASS $K_S$ from \citet{2003AJ....126.1090C}. The $\Delta K_X$ value for the given pair was then computed as $2.5log_{10}(F_1/F_2)$. 

We repeated this process with 5000 unique combinations of the 183 stars for 12 different filter/instrument combinations. For each filter and instrument combination we computed a best-fit line to $\Delta K_S -\Delta K_X$ as a function of $\Delta K_X$. We show four examples in Figure~\ref{fig:mags}. For the majority of the filters considered, the trend is insignificant compared to errors in the underlying spectra and absolute calibration (1-2\%). We did not apply a correction in these cases. Most of the scatter seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mags} is due to random errors in the input calibrated spectra and distance. $K_{\rm{cont}}$, for example, shows a larger apparent scatter in Figure~\ref{fig:mags}, primarily because the narrow band is more sensitive to random Poisson errors in the calibrated spectra, but the final precision on the calibration is smaller. The uncertainties on applied corrections were 0.01-0.02~mag for all filters, which was driven primarily by potential systematic errors in the underlying spectra.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}

We did not see a significant difference in any derived correction based on the metallicity of the component stars, as expected based on how [Fe/H] changes $K$-band flux levels (Figure~\ref{fig:metal}). Thus we did not attempt to include [Fe/H] in these relations. We also found no significant effect as a function of the mass of the primary. However, this was difficult to test due to limitations of the input sample. The \citet{Mann2015b} spectral sample covers K7 to M7, but is poorly populated on the extreme ends. While we can make a wide range of combinations of low-contrast systems (M0+M0 to M6+M6), we have limited options for high-contrast (where primary can only be $\sim$ K7-M1) systems where temperature effects would be most clear.

The best-fit (highest likelihood) is shown as a black line, with 50 randomly selected orbit fits from the MCMC shown in grey to provide an estimate of the uncertainties. In some fits, the range of orbital solutions is so small that the grey lines are not visible underneath the best-fit black line. Points are individual separation and position angle measurements with adopted uncertainties, color-coded by the data source (Gemini/NIRI in light blue, VLT/NaCo in blue, CFHT/KIR in light red, Keck/NIRC2 in dark red, and literature data in green). The dashed line is the line of nodes, the dotted line indicates periastron passage, and the arrow marks the direction of motion. }
