\begin{abstract}
The mass-luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a critical tool for estimating masses of late-type stars. Recent advancements in techniques to measure [Fe/H] for M dwarfs, an increasing number of benchmark systems near the hydrogen burning limit, the availability of {\it Gaia} parallaxes, and the need for higher-precision masses of cool stars motivate an update to existing relations. Here we present an empirical \mmk\ relation covering 0.70$M_\odot$ to the hydrogen burning limit ($\simeq0.075M_\odot$). The relation is calibrated from 59 nearby binary systems, whose orbits we determine using a a combination of our own monitoring with NIRC2 on Keck, archival adaptive optics data, and astrometry from the literature. From their orbital parameters we determine total masses of each system to better than 1\% in the best cases (median precision on $M_*$ of 6.1\%). We join our mass determinations with resolved \mks\ magnitudes for binary component stars to constrain the relation between \mks\ and $M_*$. Our equation can yield masses of single stars to 2\% for $0.10M_\odot<M_*<0.55M_\odot$, and 4\% for $0.075M_\odot<M_*<0.18M_\odot$ or $0.55M_\odot<M_*<0.75M_\odot$. The primarily limit to this precision is from higher than expected scatter around the best-fit formula, possibly due to intrinsic variation in the \mmk\ relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input orbits or parallaxes. We demonstrate that the effect of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation is significantly weaker than predicted by evolutionary (at $4.0\sigma$), and is likely negligible for stars in the Solar neighborhood. A sample of binaries with a wider range of [Fe/H] will be required to see if [Fe/H] becomes important for extreme metallicity samples (e.g., in the Halo).

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Over the past decade, M dwarfs have become critical for a wide range of astrophysics. On the small scale, M dwarfs are attractive targets for the identification and characterization of exoplanets. The small size, low mass, and low luminosity of late-type dwarfs facilitates the discovery of small planets \citep[e.g.][]{Muirhead2012,Martinez:2017aa,Mann:2018} and those in their circumstellar habitable zone \citep[e.g.,][]{Tarter2007,Shields:2016aa,2017Natur.544..333D}. Close-in, rocky planets are also significantly more common around M dwarfs than their Sun-like counterparts \citep{Dressing2013,2013PNAS..11019273P,Mulders2015,Gaidos2016b}

The properties of both the Milky Way and more distant galaxies are inexorably linked to the properties of their most numerous constituents \citep[$>$70\% of stars in the Solar neighborhood are M dwarfs,][]{Henry:1994fk,Reid:2004lr}. Late-type dwarfs weigh heavily on the Galactic mass function \citep[e.g.,][]{Covey:2008lr}, and are useful probes of the Milky Way's structure \citep[e.g.,][]{2008ApJ...673..864J,2017ApJ...843..141F}, kinematics \citep[e.g.,][]{2007AJ....134.2418B,2015RAA....15..860Y} and chemical evolution \citep{Woolf:2012lr,2015AJ....149..140H}. Although K and M dwarfs are much fainter than their higher-mass counterparts, they are numerous enough to impact the integrated spectra of massive galaxies; thus M dwarf fundamental properties have become an essential component to studies of the extragalactic initial mass function \citep[e.g.,][]{2012ApJ...747...69C,2016ApJ...821...39M} and mass-to-light ratio \citep{2015MNRAS.452L..21S}. M dwarf - white dwarf pairs are a plausible progenitor for Type Ia supernovae \citep{2012ApJ...758..123W}, and hence late-type stars may be important on cosmological scales.

%Late-type stars also play an important role on extragalactic and potentially cosmological scales. Recent non-detection of Type Ia supernovae progenitors have shifted the field from single-degenerate origins (evolved star and a white dwarf) towards a double-degenerate model (two white dwarfs), however, single degenerate models with an M dwarf and a white dwarf are still plausible . 

For all these areas, it is essential that we have a method to estimate the fundamental parameters of late-type dwarfs. Spectra, photometry, and distances of stars provide a relatively direct means to measure \teff\ \citep[e.g.,][]{Rojas-Ayala:2012uq,Mann2013c}, luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{2002AJ....124.2721R}, metallicity \citep[e.g.,][]{2005A&A...442..635B,2010ApJ...720L.113R}, and radii \citep[e.g., via Stefan-Boltzmann, ][]{Newton2015A,2018arXiv180404133K}. Masses, however, are much more difficult to infer from observational data alone, yet they are one of the most important and fundamental properties of a star.  

In the case of a binary, it is possible to directly determine the mass of a star through Kepler's laws, provided that the system's orbit can be mapped out on reasonable timescales. For shot-period systems, this can be done by monitoring the radial velocity variation of binary components, which can yield a measurement of individual component masses, but is limited by constraints on the orbital inclination \citep[e.g.,][]{Torres2002,Kraus2011,2017arXiv171205046S}. In systems where binary components can be spatially resolved, monitoring of the position and separation of the binary can yield a measurement of the total system mass, assuming the parallax is known or measured from the same astrometry \citep[e.g.,][]{Soderhjelm1999,Woi2003,2009ApJ...699..168D}.  

For single stars, mass estimates can be derived from evolutionary models \citep[e.g.,][]{Muirhead2012a,2012ApJ...747...69C}. However, differences between empirical and model-predicted mass-radius and radius-luminosity relations for late-type stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Boyajian2012,Feiden2012a} raise concerns about the reliability of model-based masses. Further, the masses derived depend on both the model grid used \citep{Spada2013,MIST1}, and the observed parameter over which the interpolation is done \citep[e.g., color versus luminosity,][]{Mann:2012,Mann2015b}. Ultimately, these models need to be tested, and if necessary, refined. 

A more empirical approach to estimating single-star masses is to use a relation between mass and luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{Henry:1993fk, Delfosse2000}, calibrated with with dynamical mass measurements from binary stars. Absolute magnitude can be used as a proxy for luminosity, and is generally easy to measure for visual binaries from the same data used to measure the orbit. Models predict a tighter relation using NIR bands than for optical, as the effect of detailed abundances on the absolute flux levels of M dwarfs is is much weaker past 1.2\um\ when compared to optical regions of the spectrum. As a result, the $M_K-M_*$ relation provides the most precise masses and has become the most commonly used relation. 

%, as methods to measure precise spectroscopic metallicities of M dwarfs have only recently become possible recently \citep[e.g.,][]{2010ApJ...720L.113R,2014A&A...568A.121N}, previous studies were unable to test what role metallicity does have on the $M_K$-mass relation, if any. 
%This method is effective for stars below $\simeq0.7M_\odot$, as the relation between mass and luminosity changes negligibly on Gyr timescales \citep{BHAC15,MIST1}. 

Some of the most widely used empirical mass-luminosity relations for low-mass stars were those from \citet{Henry:1993fk} and \citet{Delfosse2000}, which provide mass determinations precise to $\simeq$10\%, with more recent improvements by \citet{Benedict2016}. These relations have been extremely useful across a range of science cases detailed above. However, as fields that rely on M dwarf parameters have pushed to higher precision, there has been need for proportionately improved precision on M dwarf masses. Further, the he arrival of {\it Gaia} parallaxes, even late-type dwarfs beyond the Solar neighborhood now have $<1\%$ parallaxes, making scatter in the \mmk\ relation the primary source of error when estimating their masses. Existing relations also have gaps in their calibration sample, particularly below $0.1M_\odot$ where there are new exoplanet surveys in need of more precise stellar masses \citep[e.g.,][]{2017Natur.542..456G}. Lastly, methods to measure the metallicities of single M dwarfs have recently become available \citep[e.g.,][]{2010ApJ...720L.113R, 2014A&A...568A.121N,2016A&A...586A.100L}, making it possible to explore the impact of metallicity on the \mmk\ relation. 

Here we present a revised empirical relation between $M_*$, $M_{K_S}$, and [Fe/H] spanning almost an order of magnitude in mass, from 0.075$M_\odot$ to 0.70$M_\odot$, and typical metallicities in the Solar neighborhood ($-0.6<$[Fe/H]$<+0.4$). The relation is built on orbital fits to visual binaries from a combination of adaptive optics imaging and astrometric measurements in the literature with metallicities estimated from their near-infrared spectra. In Section~\ref{sec:targets} we detail our selection of nearby late-type binaries with orbits amenable to mass determinations. We overview our astrometric and spectroscopic observations in Section~\ref{sec:obs}, including those from telescope archives and the literature. Our orbit-fitting procedure is explained in Section~\ref{sec:orbit}. We describe our method to determine other parameters of each system ([Fe/H], distance, and \mks) in Section~\ref{sec:params}. Our technique to fit \mmk\ relation from these binaries is described in Section~\ref{sec:relation}, including an analysis of the errors as a function of \mks, a detailed look at the effects of [Fe/H], and a comparison to earlier relations. We conclude in Section~\ref{sec:discussion} with a brief summary, and a discussion of the important caveats and complications to consider when using our relation, as well as future directions we are taking to expand on the work given here.

\section{Target Selection}\label{sec:targets}
%$0.075M_\odot \lesssim M_* \lesssim0.70M_\odot$ stars on their main sequence

Our selection of binaries was designed to sample the region of mass space over which the mass-luminosity relation should not evolve significantly between the zero-age main sequence and the age of the Universe. We quantified this using the \citet{BHAC15} models, which we show in Figure~\ref{fig:age}. Above $0.75M_\odot$, a fixed luminosity (the observable) could correspond to a $\simeq$5\% range in masses over 1-10\, Gyr. Stars with $\simeq0.1M_\odot$ take a long time (100-1000\,Myr) to arrive on the main sequence, but obey a tight relation beyond this point. Those objects below $\simeq0.08M_\odot$ are predicted to never reach the main sequence and hence obey no mass-luminosity relation (although this transition likely depends on metallicity). We therefore attempt to select systems spanning $0.075M_\odot \lesssim M_* \lesssim0.70M_\odot$.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

We first selected systems by cross-matching catalogs of nearby M dwarfs \citep{Lepine:2013, Gaidos2014, 2014ApJ...784..156D,Winters2015}, with the fourth catalog of interferometric measurements of binary stars \citep[INT4,][]{Hartkopf:2001}, and adaptive optics (AO) images from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA). As part of this cross-match, we also included targets matching the M dwarf selection criteria of \citet{Gaidos2014}, but with a bluer color cut ($V-J>1.8$) to incorporate additional late-K dwarfs. We kept any binaries with separations less than 5\arcsec. We then added in other known late-type binaries from \citet{2008MNRAS.384..150L}, \citet{Janson2012}, \citet{Jnn2014}, and \citet{Ward-Duong2015}. This provided a list of more than 300 systems.

From here we selected those for which we expect to be able to obtain a precise orbit on a reasonable (few year) timescale. We assumed the average of available (literature) separation measurements represented the typical semi-major axis of the system. We then identified systems for which we would have at least 30\% of the orbit within the two years of our orbital monitoring program with Keck. This cut accounted for existing data. As a result, long-period binaries with extensive previous observations were included, depending on the baseline available, while those with only a single epoch would generally need to have orbits of $\ll$10 years to be observed. After this cut we were left with 125 systems. With the exception of 38 systems in the far South ($\delta<-30^\circ$, outside the range of Keck), all of these were included in our observing program.

We removed 21 systems from our analysis because of an unresolved tertiary (or quaternary) component noted in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{2010ApJ...720.1727L,2002A&A...382..118T,2018ApJS..235....6T}. In their current form, such systems are not useful for our analysis, as we have no $\Delta K$ magnitudes or mass ratios for the unresolved components. Since many of these are double- or triple-lined systems, it is possible to recover their parameters with multi-epoch radial velocities, and some systems already have the necessary data in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{Sgr2000}. We are actively monitoring these systems with high-resolution near-infrared spectrographs \citep{2010SPIE.7735E..1MY,Park2014,2012SPIE.8446E..2CR}, but they are excluded from the analysis done here. Triples where the third component is more distant (and well resolved) were retained.

A total of 18 systems were flagged as young, all of which were tagged to nearby young moving groups or clusters \citep{Shkolnik2012, Kraus2014, Gagne2014, Malo2014a, Gagne2015, 2017AJ....153...95R, 2017AJ....154...69S, Rizzuto2017, 2018MNRAS.475.2955L}. We continued to monitor these targets even after flagging them as young, but they were not included in the analysis for this paper. Many of these are expected to be pre-main-sequence stars and hence will not follow the same mass-luminosity relation. Even for those that are on the main-sequence, such young M dwarfs may have higher luminosities for a given mass \citep[e.g.,][]{2015ApJ...807....3K,Stassun2012,Somers2017}. These young systems will be the subject of a future study into the effects of age and activity on the parameters of M dwarfs. We note that this cut did not remove any young stars in the field population.

After the completion of our observing program, we removed targets for which we had $<$30\% of the orbit or fewer than six unique measurements. We attempted to fit orbits of the remaining 75 systems (Section~\ref{sec:orbit}). Seven of the orbits fits failed to converge, mostly because their semi-major axes were much larger than expected (e.g., eccentric systems caught near periapsis). An additional 16 were removed because the derived mass for the system was too imprecise ($>$20\% errors on $M_{tot}$) to be useful. Most of these 16 were systems with a poor or no parallax. This left us with 52 binaries (106 stars).

We added in seven targets with orbits from \citet{Dupuy2017}, primarily to fill in the sample around the end of the M dwarf sequence. These seven were selected because they are massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion and satisfy all our other selection criteria. Systems from \citet{Dupuy2017} also had their orbits fit using a nearly identical method to our own, often using similar or identical data and observational methods (primarily Keck/NIRC2). Two systems in \citet{Dupuy2017} satisfy our other criteria, but were still omitted from this analysis. These were LP415-20, which \citet{Dupuy2017} argue is an unresolved triple, and 2M1847+55, which has a relatively imprecise orbit compared to the rest of the sample.

Basic parameters of the final 59 systems included in our analysis are given in Table~\ref{tab:sample}.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction}\label{sec:obs} 

\subsection{Near-infrared Spectra with IRTF/SpeX}

To estimate the metallicities of our targets we obtained near-infrared spectra for 56 of 59 targets using the SpeX spectrograph \citep{Rayner2003} on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) atop Maunakea. Observations were taken between May 2011 and November 2017. Most data were taken as part of programs to characterize the fundamental properties of nearby M dwarfs \citep[e.g.,][]{Mann2013c,Gaidos2014,Terrien2015}. All spectra were taken in SXD mode, providing simultaneous wavelength coverage from 0.9 to 2.5$\mu$m. For 56 of the targets, observations were taking using the 0.3$\times15\arcsec$ slit, which yielded a resolution of $R\simeq2000$. Spectra for two targets were taken from \citet{2009ApJ...706..328D}, \citet{Dupuy2012}, or \citet{Dupuy2017}, using the 0.5$\times15\arcsec$ or 0.8$\times15\arcsec$ slits, which gave spectral resolutions of $\simeq$750-1500. 

For Gl 65 and HD 239960 the SpeX slit was aligned to get spectra of both targets simultaneously. For all other targets the binary was unresolved or too poorly resolved to separate in the reduction procedure, and instead the slit was aligned with the parallactic angle. Each target was nodded between two positions along the slit to remove  sky background. Depending on the target brightness and conditions, between 6 and 30 individual exposures were taken following this nodding pattern, with exposure times varying from 8s to 180s. An A0V-type star was observed immediately before or after each target to measure (and remove) telluric lines and flux calibrate the spectrum. The final stacked spectra had S/N of $>100$ per resolving element in the $K$-band for all but the four faintest targets (which had S/N$>50$). 

Basic data reduction was performed with \textit{SpeXTool} package \citep{Cushing2004}. This included flat fielding, sky subtraction, extraction of the one-dimensional spectrum, wavelength calibration, stacking of individual exposures, and merging of separate orders. Telluric lines were removed and the spectrum was flux calibrated using the A0V star observations and the \textit{xtellcor} software package \citep{Vacca2003}. When possible, the same A0V star was used for multiple targets taken near each other in time. 

Two of the three targets lacking a SpeX data are too warm (earlier than K5) to derive a metallicity from NIR spectra (Gl 792.1 and Gl 765.2), and the third (Gl 54) is too far south to be observed with IRTF. 

\subsection{Adaptive Optics Imaging and Masking}\label{sec:ao}

We analyzed a mix of AO data from our own program with Keck/NIRC2 and archival imaging from the Keck II Telescope, the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and the Gemini North Telescope. In general we analyzed all usable images (e.g., non saturated, components resolved) regardless of observing mode and filter. 

For our analysis, we considered a single dataset a collection images with a unique filter, target, or observing date. Each combined dataset consisted of a $\Delta m$ (for a given filter), separation, and position angle. 

We separate the observations and reduction by instrument/telescope below. The full list of astrometry and contrast measurements is given in Table~\ref{tab:astrom}, sorted by target. 

\subsubsection{Keck II/NIRC2 Imaging and Masking}

As part of a long-term monitoring program with Keck II atop Maunakea, between June 2015 and November 2017 we observed 49 of the 52 multiple-star systems fit in this paper. All observations were taken using the facility AO imager NIRC2 using the vertical angle mode (fixed angle relative to elevation axis) and the narrow camera ($\approx$10\,mas\,pixel$^{-1}$). Depending on target brightness and observing conditions, imaging was usually taken with either the $K'$ ($\lambda_c=2.124$\um) or narrow $K_{\rm{cont}}$ ($\lambda_c=2.2706$\um) filters, and non-redundant aperture masking (NRM) was always taken using the 9-hole mask and $K'$ filter. After acquiring the target and allowing the AO loops to close, we took four to 10 images or 6-8 interferograms, adjusting coadds and integration time based on the brightness of the target. As most of our targets are bright, observations were generally taking using the Natural Guide Star (NGS) system \citep{2000PASP..112..315W,2004ApOpt..43.5458V}, only utilizing the Laser Guide Star (LGS) mode for the faintest ($R\gtrsim13$) targets or in mixed conditions. In total, our observations provided 154 datasets.

In addition to our own data, we downloaded images from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA), spanning March 2002 to November 2015, all also taken with the NIRC2 imager. Archive data comprised a wide range of observing modes, filters, and cameras, although the majority was taken with the narrow camera and one of the $H$- or $K$-band filters. We included nearly all data with clear detections of both binary components independent of the observing setup. We discarded saturated images, those taken with the coronagraph atop one or both binary components, and those with extremely poor AO correction. A total of 36 datasets were used from the archive. 

The same data reduction was applied to both observations from our own program and those from the archive, following our custom procedure described in \citet{Kraus2016a}. To briefly summarize, we linearized each frame then dark and flat corrected using calibration data taken the same night. In cases where no appropriate darks or flats were taken in the same night, we use a set from the nearest available night. We interpolated over ``dead'' and ``hot'' pixels, which were identified from superflats and superdarks built from data spanning 2006 to 2016. Because flats are rarely taken in narrowband filters, we used superflats built from the nearest (in wavelength) broadband filter where appropriate (e.g., for $K_{\rm{cont}}$ we used $K$ or $K'$). Pixels with flux levels $>10\sigma$ above the median of the eight adjacent pixels (primarily cosmic rays) were replaced with the median (average of the 4th and 5th ranked). Images were visually inspected as part of identifying the binary location, and a handful ($<$1\%) of images were negatively impacted by our cosmic ray removal (e.g., removal of part of the source). These images were manually corrected.


\subsubsection{CFHT/PUEO Imaging}

We obtained data for 31 of our targets the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre take with the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) using the Adaptive Optics Bonnette \citep[AOB, often referred to as PUEO after the Hawaiian owl,][]{1994SPIE.2201..833A} and the KIR infrared camera \citep{1998SPIE.3354..760D}. After removing bad observations (e.g., saturated, unresolved, or poor AO correction), 226 datasets were included. Observations spanned December 1997 to January 2007, covering most of the time PUEO was in use at CFHT (1996 to 2011). Most observations were taken in a few-year period from 2000 to 2003. Observations spanned a range of filters across $JHK$ bands, but the majority used either the narrowband [Br$\gamma$] or [FeII] filters. All observations used a 3-5 point dither pattern and took at least two images at each dither location. 

Data reduction for PUEO observations followed the same basic steps as our NIRC2 data. We first applied flat-fielding and dark correction using a set of superflats and superdarks built by splitting the datasets into 6 month blocks and combining calibration data within the same time period. We identified bad pixels by making large median stacks of science data taken across dozens of objects, which were then replaced with the median of the eight surrounding pixels To identify cosmic rays, we median stacked consecutive images of each target (at a fixed location), then compared the stack to individual images. Pixels $>10\sigma$ above the robust mean of the stacks are replaced with the median of the eight surrounding points. Because PUEO/KIR data were taken in sets of $>$5 images before the object was dithered, this median stacking was effective for removing nearly all cosmic rays.


\subsubsection{VLT/NaCo Imaging}

We downloaded AO-assisted images from the ESO archive taken with the Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NAOS-CONICA, or NaCo) instrument on VLT. Data spanned November 2001 to October 2016, with about half of these 70 datasets taken from 2001 to 2005. Based on the program abstracts, $\lesssim$1/2 of the observations were meant to use these binaries as astrometric or photometric calibration (e.g., science case is unrelated to M dwarfs or binaries). Data were available for 20 of our targets, excluding saturated or otherwise unusable data. Observations were taken with a wide range of filters, cameras, and observing patterns, but the majority were taken using the S13 camera ($\approx$13\,mas\,pixel$^{-1}$) with either broadband $K_s$ and $L$, or narrowband [FeII] and [Br$\gamma$] filters, and always following a 2-4 point dither pattern. 

Basic data reduction was applied to NaCo images following a similar procedure as with the PUEO and NIRC2 data. We applied flat-fielding and dark corrections to each observation using the standard set of calibrations taken each night as part of the VLT queue. In the case where calibration (dark or flat) images were missing or unusable, we used the nearest (in time) set of calibration images matching the filter (for flats) and exposure setup (for darks). Flats taken in broadband filters were used for flat-fielding narrow-band images at similar wavelengths. We built bad pixel masks using median stacks of all images taken within a night after applying flat and dark corrections. To identify and remove cosmic rays we used the L.A. Cosmic software \citep{2001PASP..113.1420V}.


\subsubsection{Gemini/NIRI Imaging}

We retrieved 39 datasets for 8 of our targets from the Gemini archive, all taken with the AO imager NIRI \citep{2003PASP..115.1388H} on the Gemini North Telescope. All observations were taken between August 2008 and February 2011 and were taken with the assistance of the ALTtitude conjugate Adaptive optics for the InfraRed (ALTAIR). Most observations were taken with the f32 camera ($\approx$21\,mas\,pixel$^{-1}$) using broadband $J$-, $H$-, or $K$-band filters. All observations followed a 2-4 point dither pattern and took at least two images at each dither location. 

Data from NIRI were reduced using the same basic tools as for all other adaptive optics data. First, we applied flat and dark corrections to each set of images using the standard calibration images taken as part of the Gemini queue, usually within 24h of the target observations. In most cases, flats taken in broadband filters were used for narrowband flat-fielding. We then identified bad pixels from median stacking all images within a given night. Observations with a target near or on top of a heavily impacted pixel were discarded (identified with the mask). We used the L.A. Cosmic software for the identification and removal of cosmic rays. 

\section{Measuring astrometry and photometry}\label{sec:astrometry}

Extracting separations and position angle measurements followed a similar multi-step procedure across all instruments, excluding the NRM data (which is described below). Our method is based largely on that described in \citet{2016ApJ...817...80D} and \citet{Dupuy2017}, which is built on the techniques from \citet{2008ApJ...689..436L} and \citet{2010ApJ...721.1725D} and we briefly describe here. 

We first cross-correlated each image with a model Gaussian PSF to identify the most significant peaks. The cross-correlation peak occasionally centers on instrumental artifacts, often struggles to separate out partially overlapping binaries, and can easily identify the wrong source for triple systems. So this step was checked by eye and updated as needed. The eye-check phase also allowed us to manually remove data of poor quality: e.g., no or poor AO correction, saturated data, or an unresolved system. We used these centers as the initial guess for the $X, Y$ pixel position used in the next phase. 

We then fit the PSF centers by either: 1) fitting the binary image with a PSF modeled by three-component elliptical 2D Gaussians using the least-squares minimization routine MPFIT \citep{Markwart2009}, or 2) running StarFinder, a routine designed to measure astrometry and photometry from adaptive optics data by deriving a PSF template from the image and iteratively fitting this model to the components \citep[for more details, see][]{2000A&AS..147..335D}. Although the results of these two methods generally agreed, StarFinder was preferred, as it used a more realistic model of the PSF and worked even with mediocre AO correction, provided the component PSFs were well separated. StarFinder, however, failed on the tightest binaries, where it was unable to distinguish two stars and thus incorrectly built a pathological, extended PSF that fit the blended image. The Gaussian fit was used for any case where StarFinder failed. 

As part of the PSF fit, both methods provide a flux ratio of the PSF normalization factors, which we used this to determine $\Delta m$ in the relevant band. Data from all filters are used for astrometry, although only $\Delta K$ measurements were used in the estimate of \mks\ (Section~\ref{sec:mags}).

PSF fitting provides pixel-position ($x$, $y$) measurements of each component, but converting these to separation and position angle (PA) on the sky requires an astrometric calibration of the instrument. For the NIRC2 narrow camera, we used the \citet{Yelda2010} distortion solution for data taken before 2015 Apr 13 UT, and \citet{2016PASP..128i5004S} for data taken after this. These calibrations include a pixel scale and orientation determination of 9.952$\pm$0.002 mas\,pixel$^{-1}$ and $0.252\pm0.009^\circ$ for the former, and 9.971$\pm$0.004 mas\,pixel$^{-1}$ and $0.262\pm0.020^\circ$ for the latter. For the NIRC2 wide camera we used the solution from Fu et al. (2012, priv. comm.)\footnote{\href{http://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/~haifu/idl/nirc2wide/}{http://homepage.physics.uiowa.edu/$\sim$haifu/idl/nirc2wide/}}, with a pixel scale of $39.686\pm0.008$ mas\,pixel$^{-1}$ and the same orientation as the narrow camera. For the f32 camera on NIRI, we used the distortion solution from the Gemini webpage\footnote{\href{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/undistort.pro}{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/undistort.pro}}. 

For other instruments and cameras, data were always taken following a dither pattern to sample different regions of the CCD distortion pattern. So the RMS between dithered images should reflect errors due to uncorrected distortion (which is included in our errors; see below). For KIR, we adopted a pixel scale of 34.8$\pm$0.1 mas pixel$^{-1}$ \citep{2003ApJ...589..410S} and an orientation of $0\pm2^\circ$\footnote{\href{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Detectors/IR/KIR/}{KIR specifications, filters, and performance.}}. For NaCo, we assumed a pixel scale of 13.24$\pm0.05$ mas pixel$^{-1}$ for the S13 camera \citep{2003A&A...411..157M,2005A&A...435L..13N} and the values given in the ESO documentation for all others\footnote{\href{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/doc.html}{NaCo Documentation, user manual, calibration, and reduction.}} (with the same error). The rotation taken from the NaCo headers was assumed to be correct to 0.4$^\circ$ \citep{Sef2008}. For NIRI observations, we used a pixel scale provided by Gemini\footnote{\href{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/pixel-scales-fov-and-field-orientation}{NIRI pixel scales, field of view, and field orientation.}} for each camera (117.1, 49.9, and 21.9 mas pixel$^{-1}$ for f6, f14, and f32, respectively), with a global uncertainty of 0.05 mas pixel$^{-1}$ on the pixel scale and 0.7$^\circ$ on the orientation. The NIRI orientation error was determined using observations of the same target between observing runs (separated by weeks to months), but over which no orbital motion should have been visible ($P>$50 years). 

Extraction of separations and position angles from of masking observations followed the appendix of \citet{Kraus2008} with the aid of the latest version of the `Sydney' aperture-masking interferometry code\footnote{\href{https://github.com/mikeireland/idlnrm}{https://github.com/mikeireland/idlnrm}}. To remove systematics, the observation of each target observed with NRM was paired with a calibration observation of another nearby star taken in the same night with a similar magnitude and airmass. Binary system profiles were then fit to the closure phases to produce estimates of the separation, position angle, and contrast of the binary components. More details on the analysis of masking data can be found in \citet{2006ApJ...650L.131L}, \citet{Kraus2008} and \citet{2012ApJ...744..120E}.

Data from a single night and with the same filter and target were combined into a single measurement (after applying all corrections above), with errors estimated using the RMS in the individual images within a night. This scatter across images was combined with the uncertainty in the orientation and pixel scale in quadrature. We assumed pixel scale and orientation uncertainties were correlated within a night and filter (so they do not decrease with $\sqrt{N}$). 

We applied an additional correction for differential atmospheric refraction \citep{2010SPIE.7736E..1IL} using filter wavelength information and weather data from the header (for VLT) or from the CFHT weather archive\footnote{\href{http://mkwc.ifa.hawaii.edu/archive/wx/cfht/}{CFHT weather archive.}} (for Keck, CFHT, and Gemini). We neglected the chromatic component of this effect as the correction is already small compared to measurement errors. 


\subsection{Literature Astrometry}\label{sec:litas}

We included astrometric measurements from the literature for 50 of the 52 binaries in our sample. To help identify sources of astrometry, we used the fourth catalog of interferometric observations of binary stars \citep[INT4,][]{Hartkopf:2001}. We only used measurements that included both a separation and position angle. In cases of literature data also available in one of the archives above, we adopted our own measurements over the literature data to ensure more homogeneous measurements and errors. We did not utilize $\Delta m$ measurements from the literature, although in some cases this information was used to verify the astrometry was for the correct binary system or component.  

In total, we used 558 measurements (each including a separation and position angle) from 60 references. The literature astrometry was asymmetrically distributed; roughly half of the points were for just 11 targets, predominately taken with the goal of measuring their orbits. Approximately 180 measurements came from speckle observations on the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) 6m \citep[e.g.,][]{Bag2002}, WIYN \citep[e.g.,][]{Hor2017}, or SOAR \citep[][]{Tok2017b}, which tend to observe a wide range of nearby and/or bright binaries. About 160 points came from {\it HST}, primarily using the fine guidance sensors \citep[e.g.,][]{Benedict2016}, and was focused on monitoring a small subset ($\simeq$10 binaries) of the sample to obtain precise orbits and masses. The rest of the measurements were from a mix of surveys focusing on taking many epochs of specific systems to determine orbits \citep[e.g.,][]{Koh2012} and broader surveys (e.g., for multiplicity) that obtain 1-2 epochs on each of dozens of binaries \citep[e.g.,][]{Janson2012}.  

One complication using older literature astrometry was the issue of inhomogeneous reporting of separation and position angle errors. Many references provided measurements without errors, and many more reported errors without accounting for field distortion or errors in the pixel scale and orientation. We mitigated this problem by generating an error common to a given reference. For each literature source, we identified a set of binaries where an orbit can be fit (with $<$5\% errors on the angular separation) without astrometry from that particular reference. Some literature sources were merged for this comparison, provided they used the same instrument and basic analysis. We included binaries outside the sample considered here. We fit the orbit following the method outlined in Section~\ref{sec:orbit}, using only the least-squares method for efficiency. We then compared the expected position angle and separation to the measurements from the reference in question. From this difference we computed the required missing error term, which, when added in quadrature with the reported errors (zero for those without errors) would yield a reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2_\nu$) of 1. This process was repeated twice, each time updating the errors where appropriate (although the change is small between iterations). References where we could not test the reported errors (e.g., due to insufficient data) and those with extremely large required error terms ($>$50\,mas) were not used. This term is added in quadrature with literature reported uncertainties (if any are reported). 

All literature astrometry used in this paper is listed alongside our own measurements in Table~\ref{tab:astrom}. 

\subsection{Summary of input astrometry}

In total we measured or gathered 1083 unique datasets (unique filter/night/target combinations), approximately half of which we measured from adaptive optics images (525) and the other half were from the literature (558). Most of the astrometry measurements derived from our analysis came from either NIRC2 (190 points) or PUEO (226), with a smaller contribution from NaCo (70) and NIRI (39). Although they represent only $\simeq$20\% of the total astrometric measurements, the NIRC2 measurements are the most critical in constraining orbital parameters. NIRC2 astrometry was 1-2 orders of magnitude more precise than those from the literature, and a factor of 3-8$\times$ more precise than those from PUEO, NIRI, and NaCo. 

We characterized the relative importance of each data source using the total number of unique separation measurements weighted by their uncertainties. Under this metric, the NIRC2 points contributed $\gtrsim10\times$ more total orbital information than the literature data. Measurements from CFHT/PUEO had a comparable total contribution to the literature data, each of which had $\simeq2\times$ the impact of NaCo measurements, and $\simeq3\times$ that of data from NIRI. This comparison likely underestimated the importance of the NIRC2 data; literature and archive images tended to be concentrated on the best-characterized systems, while our NIRC2 observations were specifically coordinated to complete orbits and cover under- or un-sampled regions of binary orbits. However, the combination of NIRC2 and literature and/or PUEO points is the most useful, since this provides both the precision and long baseline (PUEO and NIRC2 data is typically separated by $>15$\,years) needed to fully constrain the orbital parameters.

\section{Orbit Fitting}\label{sec:orbit}

We fit the astrometry with the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) software \textit{emcee} \citep{Foreman-Mackey2013}, a python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler \citep{goodman2010}. For each system, we fit for seven orbital elements: the orbital period ($P$), combined angular semi-major axis ($a\arcsec$), eccentricity ($e$), inclination ($i$), epoch of periastron passage ($T_0$), argument of periastron ($\omega$), and position angle of the line of nodes ($\Omega$). Parameters were limited by physical or definitional constraints, e.g., $P>0$, $0<e<1$, and $0<i<\pi$, but were given no additional boundaries. 

We applied priors of 1/$P$, 1/$a\arcsec$, and $\sin(i)$ to $P$, $a\arcsec$, and $i$, respectively. All other parameters evolved under uniform priors. Walkers were initialized with the best-fit orbit determined using \textit{MPFIT} \citep{Markwart2009} with a spread in starting values based on the \textit{MPFIT} estimated errors. Each MCMC chain was initially run for $10^5$ steps with 100 walkers. We tested to see if a chain converged using the autocorrelation time \citep{2010CAMCS...5...65G} and chains were checked by eye for signs on convergence. In about 1/4 of the systems the fit did not converge after the initial $10^5$ steps, so we ran these for $10^6$ total steps. Those that did not converge after $10^6$ steps were not included in our final sample. These are not counted in our final sample of 59 binaries (see Section~\ref{sec:targets}), as these were the least-well characterized systems. We saved every 100 steps in the chain, and the first 5\% of each chain was removed for burn-in. 

Systems of near-equal mass may have the primary and companion misidentified, both in our own measurements and also those taken from the literature. We identified such points by eye during the \textit{MPFIT} stage and manually adjusted the position angles before starting the MCMC run. In total $\simeq$16 points were corrected this way, almost all of which were for three systems with contrast ratios close to unity. A more robust solution to this problem would be to feed a double-peaked prior at the reported value and $\pm$180$^\circ$ into the likelihood function. However, in all cases the problematic points were obvious by eye, had reported $\Delta m$ consistent with zero, and a simple 180$^\circ$ correction completely fixed the orbit.

\caption{Example results of our orbit fitting procedure for Gl 301AB (left), Gl 469AB (middle), and GJ 3454AB (right). Points are individual measurements of the separation and position angle, color-coded by the astrometry source. Black solid line shows the best-fit (highest likelihood).

All orbits are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:a1}.}
\label{fig:orbits}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Overall the quality of the fits is extremely good, with $\chi^2_\nu$ values ranging from 0.1 to 2, and cumulative distribution values (the probability of getting the $\chi^2$ or smaller given the degrees of freedom) from 2\% to 99\% (mean probability of 47\%). We show some example orbital fits in Figure~\ref{fig:orbits} (with the full set in the Appendix~\ref{sec:orbitplots}) and provide the median orbital parameters in Table~\ref{tab:orbits}. Orbits span a wide range in orbital period; the tightest binaries have $P<1$\,yr, while the widest have $P>50$\,yr. The two systems with $P>50$\,yr (Gl 301 and Gl 277) were also some of the least-well characterized. 

Our orbital fits made heavy use of literature astrometry, many of which had no reported errors. Our method for assigning or correcting errors assumed that all measurements have a common missing error term per source (Section~\ref{sec:litas}). It is more likely that errors depend on the separation and contrast ratio, as well as quantities that were not consistently reported, like weather, setup, and observational strategy. Further, this technique assumed an uncorrelated error term. In the case of an erroneous pixel scale or imperfectly aligned instrument, all measurements from a common instrument may be off in the same direction. In practice, it is difficult to correct for these effects without access to the actual images. The data suggest this does not impact our results; the final $\chi^2_\nu$ values for the best-fit orbits shows no correlation with the fraction of astrometry from the literature versus our own measurements, and measurements taken on the same target and night but from different sources agree within errors. 

As an additional test, we tried refitting six binaries with the most literature data twice, first doubling the error term added to the literature points, then halving it. In all cases, overall parameters and errors did not change significantly (although the final $\chi^2_\nu$ values changed). The main reason for this is that our measurements are generally far more more precise (with the exception of measurements from {\it HST}) and disproportionately weigh on the final solution, even in cases where most of the data is from the literature. In the case of halving errors, the MCMC would land on a similar solution, but with smaller parameter uncertainties and an extremely poor $\chi^2$ for the degrees of freedom. We conclude this treatment of errors does not significantly impact our final orbital fits. 

\section{Stellar Parameters}\label{sec:params}

\subsection{Parallaxes}\label{sec:plx}

Parallaxes for 56 of the targets were drawn from the literature. In general we adopted the most precise parallax available, although preference is given to those accounting for the binarity of the target and those with a baseline significantly different from the binary's orbital period. A few systems are in hierarchical triples with a wider companion with has an independent parallax measurement, which we used where possible. For $\simeq$1/3 of the sample, we drew parallaxes from the new reduction of the Hipparcos data \citep{van-Leeuwen:2007yq}. For the seven systems from \citet{Dupuy2017} we used their parallaxes, and those from \citet{Benedict2016} for 13 systems overlapping with our own sample. For nine systems we pulled parallaxes from the general catalogue of trigonometric parallaxes \citep{van-Altena1995}. 

About half (28) of our targets do not have entries in the second data release of {\it Gaia} \citep[DR2, ][]{GaiaDr2,2018arXiv180409365G}. They were likely excluded because centroid shifts from orbital motion prevented a five-parameter (single-star) solution (a requirement to be included in DR2). We also found significant differences between the {\it Gaia} values and earlier measurements \citep[including from {\it Gaia} DR1, ][]{gaiadr1}. Many wide triples in {\it Gaia} DR2 (where the third star is several arc seconds away, and hence easily resolved) have significantly different parallaxes reported for the unresolved pair than for the wider companion. Orbital motion is likely impacting the parallax values or uncertainties, an issue that should be resolved in future Gaia data releases that will include fits for orbital motion. We found no such issues with our other parallax sources. So we decided to not use Gaia DR2 parallaxes for any of the binaries unless they had a wide (single) companion with an independent parallax. 

We ultimately used {\it Gaia} DR2 parallaxes for three systems, GJ1245AC, GJ277AC, and GJ4287AB, where we adopted the parallax of their wider common proper motion companion. In all cases the wider associated stars are not known to harbor another unresolved star, and hence they should not be impacted by the same binarity issue. GJ 570BC, Gl 695BC, GJ 2005BC, Gl 22AC, and 2M1047+40 also have nearby associated stars. However, Gl 570A is extremely bright ($G\simeq5$) and hence may have an unreliable parallax due to saturation in DR2, GJ 2005A has no entries in {\it Gaia} DR2, the available parallaxes (from {\it HST} and Hipparcos) for Gl 695BC and Gl 22AC are similar or more precise than the those reported for Gl 695A and Gl 22B from {\it Gaia} DR2, and the wide pair to 2M1047+40 is itself a tight binary \citep[LP 213-67AB,][]{Dupuy2017} with a large reported excess astrometric noise in Gaia \citep[a sign of binarity,][]{2018RNAAS...2...20E}.

For three systems we derived new parallaxes using MEarth astrometry \citep{Nutzman:2008gf}. Updated parallaxes were measured following the procedure from \citet{2014ApJ...784..156D}. The only difference was we used a dataset with a baseline $\simeq$two years longer, which helps average out systematic errors arising from centroid motion due to the binary orbit, and significantly reduces the overall uncertainties. 

We list all parallaxes and references in Table~\ref{tab:sample}.

\subsection{Metallicity}\label{sec:feh}

We estimated [Fe/H] using our SpeX spectra and the empirical relations from \citet{Mann2013a} for K5-M6 dwarfs, and \citet{Mann2014} for M6-M9 dwarfs. These relations use a series of atomic lines (primarily Na, Ca, and K features) in the optical or NIR \citep[e.g.,][]{2010ApJ...720L.113R,Terrien:2012lr}, empirically calibrated using wide binaries containing a solar-type primary and an M-dwarf companion \citep[e.g.,][]{2005A&A...442..635B,Johnson2009,Neves2012}. The calibrations were based on the assumption that components of such binaries have similar or identical metallicities \citep[e.g.,][]{2015ApJ...801L..10T}. Similar methods have been used extensively to assign metallicities across the M dwarf sequence \citep[e.g.,][]{Terrien2015,Muirhead2015,Dressing2017,2018ApJ...853...30V,2018ApJ...854..145M}. Final adopted [Fe/H] values are given in Table~\ref{tab:sample}. Errors account for Poisson noise in the spectrum, but because of relatively high SNR are generally dominated by the uncertainties in the calibration itself, which is estimated to be 0.08~dex \citep{Mann2013a,Mann2014}.

%Uncertainties on [Fe/H] from such spectroscopic determinations are generally 0.08-0.12~dex. This exceeds the measurement uncertainties by a factor of 1.5-3 \citep{Newton:2014}. The difference may be due to inhomogeneities in the assigned primary stars' metallicities \citep[e.g.,][]{2015ApJ...805..126B,2016ApJS..225...32B,2016ApJS..226....4H}, as well as complications in using atomic lines as a proxy, which are not expected to scale perfectly with iron abundances \citep{Rojas-Ayala:2012uq,Veyette2016a}. The existing data suggest that relative abundances (one M dwarf relative to another) are far more precise than the overall scale (relative the Sun).

For all but two targets (Gl 65 and HD 239960), our NIR spectra are for the combined flux of the binary components. \citet{Mann2014} explored the issue of measuring metallicities of binaries with unresolved data by combining spectra of single-stars with similar metallicities and re-applying the same calibration. The bias introduced is negligible ($\lesssim0.02$~dex) when compared to overall uncertainties. The added scatter is smaller than the measurement uncertainties, and can be explained entirely by the Poisson noise introduced in the addition of component spectra. 

Three targets (LP415-20, 2M2140+16, and 2M2206-20) have SpeX spectra taken with a wider slit, yielding lower spectral resolution. The bands in \citet{Mann2014} are defined using a homogeneous dataset taken with the narrow (0.3\arcsec) slit, so this difference may impact the derived [Fe/H]. We tested this by convolving a set of single-star SpeX spectra taken with the 0.3\arcsec\ slit with a Gaussian to put them at the appropriate lower resolution. The median of the derived [Fe/H] values changed by $<0.01$~dex, but the change varies between targets. Based on the resulting scatter, we estimate the errors on [Fe/H] from the lower-resolution spectra to be 0.12~dex on a Solar scale and 0.08~dex on a relative scale. These targets are marked separately in Table~\ref{tab:sample}. 

Two of the targets in our sample are L dwarfs (2M0746+20 and 2M1017+13). These both are most likely above the hydrogen burning limit, and hence are included in our analysis. However, the \citet{Mann2014} method contains no L dwarf calibrators. We report our derived [Fe/H] values for these systems, but advise treating the assigned values with skepticism until an L dwarf calibration becomes available. 

Two targets (Gl 792.1 and Gl 765.2) are too warm (earlier than K5) for the calibration of \citet{Mann2013a}. For these we take [Fe/H] values from \citet{2011A&A...530A.138C} and \citet{2010A&ARv..18...67T}, respectively. These [Fe/H] measurements are not necessarily on the same scale as those from \citet{Mann2013a}, which are calibrated against abundances of Sun-like stars from \citet{2015ApJ...805..126B,2016ApJS..225...32B}. Given reported variations in [Fe/H] for these stars, as well as [Fe/H] determination differences \citep{2014AJ....148...54H,2016ApJS..226....4H} we adopt conservative 0.08~dex uncertainties on both systems. For the other target lacking a SpeX spectrum (Gl 54), we derive [Fe/H] using the optical calibration of \citet{Mann2013a} and a moderate-resolution optical spectrum taken from \citet{Gaidos2014}.

\subsection{$K_S$-magnitudes} \label{sec:mags}

We adopted unresolved $K_S$ magnitudes from the Two Micron All Sky Survey \citep[2MASS,][]{Skrutskie2006}. Some of the brightest stars in our sample are near or beyond saturation in 2MASS. For these targets we recalculated $K_S$ magnitudes using available optical and NIR spectra, following the method of \citet{Mann2015a} and \citet{Mann2015b}, using available optical spectra from \citet{Gaidos2014}. Synthetic magnitudes were broadly consistent with 2MASS $K_S$ magnitudes (and at similar precision) for fainter targets ($K_S>7$). We only updated $K_S$ magnitudes for bright systems where where our synthetic photometry differed from the 2MASS value by more than 2$\sigma$ (five systems). We mark these systems in Table~\ref{tab:sample}. 

While all targets considered here had at least one measurement in a filter centered with the $K$ band, none of the filters used were an exact match for 2MASS $K_S$. Many of the observations were taken with narrow-band $K_{\rm{cont}}$ ($\lambda_c\simeq2.27$\um) or Br$\gamma$ ($\lambda_c\simeq2.17$\um) filters, for example. We transformed these into 2MASS magnitudes before computing the final $\Delta K_S$. These corrections were usually small ($\lesssim0.1$ magnitudes), and details on their derivation are given in Appendix~\ref{sec:a1}.

To compute $\Delta K_S$, we calculated the robust weighted mean of contrast ratios derived from our AO data (Section~\ref{sec:astrometry}). For $\Delta K_S$, we used all data centered somewhere within the $K$ band. Errors on contrasts for a given dataset were the RMS in flux measurements among consecutive images. The errors may be underestimated errors because of imperfect PSF modeling, flat-fielding, uncorrected non-linearities in the detector, as well as intrinsic variability of the star. We compared $\Delta K_X$ measurements of the same star using the same filter and instrument but on different nights (Figure~\ref{fig:magnitudes}). The comparison suggested a missing error term of 0.016\,magnitudes for NIRC2, 0.02 for PUEO and NaCo, and 0.03 for NIRI. We only tested this for $K$-band filters, but we found consistent values for different $K$-band filters from the same instrument. We included this term as an additional error term in our computation of $\Delta K_S$.

%We did not use literature contrast ratios (even those in $K$-band), as we cannot perform and the same corrections applied to those from our own analysis. The exception was Gl 762.1, for which we have no AO data. For this target we adopt the value from \citet{CIA2010}.

For GJ 2005BC and Gl 900BC, the 2MASS PSF includes flux from the A component. In both cases we use our AO data to measure $\Delta K$ between all three components. The total $K_S$ magnitude given in Table~\ref{tab:sample} already have the A component removed. 

\section{The Mass-Luminosity Relation}\label{sec:relation}

\subsection{Methodology}

For main-sequence stars, the mass-luminosity relation traditionally takes the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ml}
\frac{L_*}{L_\odot} = C \left(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}\right)^\alpha,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ depends on the dominant energy transport mechanism (e.g., radiative versus convective) and internal structure of the star \citep{2004sipp.book.....H}. 

We rewrite Equation~\ref{eqn:ml} in terms of \mks\ (and $\log(M_*/M_\odot)$) instead of $L_*$. Absolute magnitudes are more easily measured than overall luminosity, and avoid introducing errors from uncertain bolometric corrections or the need to take flux-calibrated spectra in order to measure the bolometric flux directly. Switching to \mks\ also mitigates effects of abundances. The $K$-band is heavily dominated by metal-insensitive CO and H$_2$O absorption bands. Optical bands are dominated by strong molecular (e.g. TiO, CO, CaH, MgH, and VO) bands that introduce a strong dependence to [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] (Figure~\ref{fig:metal}). 

\begin{figure*}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{metallicity_effect.eps}
\caption{Effect of changes in [M/H] on a model spectrum at \teff=3200\,K, $\log(g)=5$ in $g$- (left), $r$ (middle), and $K$-band (right). The top panel shows [M/H]=0 (black) and [M/H]=+0.5 (red) spectra from the CFIST BT-SETTL models \citep{2012RSPTA.370.2765A}. The bottom panel shows the ratio of the two, highlighting how small an effect [M/H] has in the $K$-band compared to optical regions. The one feature that stands out in the $K$-band is the Na doublet, which is a commonly used as a metallicity diagnostic for dwarfs \citep{2010ApJ...720L.113R,Terrien:2012lr,Newton:2014}, and a gravity diagnostic for pre-main-sequence stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Schlieder2012}. }
\label{fig:metal}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Our sample encompasses almost an order of magnitude in mass and hence a range of underlying stellar physics. No single power law is expected to fit over the full sequence. Instead, we assumed that $\alpha$ depends on \mks, which we approximated as a polynomial. This yields a \mmk\ relation of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mmk}
\log \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i(M_{K_S}-zp)^i,
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ are the fit coefficients. The number of coefficients ($n$) was determined by testing how the fit improves with increasing $n$. The constant $zp$ is a zero-point (or anchor) magnitude, which we fixed at 7.5. This approximately corresponded to the logarithmic central mass of stars in our sample. 

For the left hand side, we computed the total system mass ($M_{\rm{tot}}$) for each binary by combining the the orbital period ($P$) and total angular semi-major axis ($a\arcsec$) from our fits to the orbital parameters (Section~\ref{sec:orbit}) with the parallaxes ($\pi$, Section~\ref{sec:plx}), following a rewritten form of Kepler's laws:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mass}
M_{\rm{tot}} = M_{1}+M_{2} = \frac{(a\arcsec/\pi)^3}{P^2},
\end{equation}
where $P$ is in years, $a\arcsec$ and $\pi$ are in arcseconds, and $M_{\rm{tot}}$ is in Solar masses. 

Because Equation~\ref{eqn:mass} does not provide component masses, when fitting for the $a_i$ coefficients we performed the comparison between the predicted and dynamical {\it total} mass for each system. For this, we rewrote Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk} in terms of total mass:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:mmk2}
M_{tot} &=& 10^{b_1} + 10^{b_2},\\
b_j &=& \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i(M_{K_S,j}-zp)^i, \label{eqn:mmk2_b}
\end{eqnarray}
where \mks$_{,1}$ and \mks$_{,2}$ are the primary and companion absolute $K$-band magnitudes, which were calculated from our measured $\Delta K_S$ and unresolved $K_S$ magnitudes (Section~\ref{sec:mags}). Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2} could easily be modified for higher-order star systems, providing individual \mks\ magnitudes and the total mass of the system are known. 

We fit for the $a_i$ terms in Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2} using the MCMC code \textit{emcee}, which lets us fit for the strong covariance between coefficients. Each coefficient evolved under uniform priors without limits, and was initialized to the best-fit value derived from \textit{MPFIT}. We ran the MCMC chain with 600 walkers for $10^6$ steps after a burn-in of 50,000 steps. We ran separate MCMC chains testing values of $n$ (fit order) from three to seven. 

Errors on the dynamical mass are correlated to the errors on \mks. The system mass scales with the cube of the semi-major axis, which depends linearly with the parallax. As a result, the parallax was a major, if not the largest, source of uncertainty on the mass for most systems. Similarly, our $K_S$ magnitudes had relatively small errors (0.01-0.03\,mag), so \mks\ errors tended to be dominated by the parallax. Because this correlation is usually along (parallel to) the direction of the \mmk\ relation, it can tighten the fit if properly taken into account (when compared to assuming uncorrelated errors). 

Our strategy was to treat distances of each system as a free parameter, letting them evolve under a prior from the observed parallax. The MCMC fit to Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2} was provided $a\arcsec^3/P^2$ and $K_S$ (with uncertainties) for each system, from which total mass and \mks\ were recomputed from the varying parallax of each system at each step in the MCMC before making a comparison. Since the orbital information provides no constraint on the distance, this effectively forced the MCMC to explore a distribution along the input prior. It is possible for the parallax posterior to shift off this prior if it provides better agreement with the relation as determined by the rest of the sample. However, in practice this does not happen; for all systems the parallax posteriors matched the input values.

For computational efficiency, we assumed Gaussian errors on $a\arcsec^3/P^2$. Although $a\arcsec$ and $P$ were often correlated and non-Gaussian, posteriors of $a\arcsec^3/P^2$ were all well-described by a Gaussian (Figure~\ref{fig:correlated}). 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{LHS6167_corner.eps}
\caption{Example joint posterior on semi-major axis and orbital period (bottom left) for the system LHS 6167. Grey regions show 1, 2, and 3$\sigma$ (from darkest to lightest) of the points. The histograms above and to the right show the one-dimensional distributions of each parameter. The parameter fed into the \mmk\ fit is $a\arcsec^3/P^2$ (in arcsec$^3$ per year$^2$), which we show in the top right inset. }
\label{fig:correlated}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For main-sequence dwarfs at fixed metallicity, more massive stars should always be brighter. Thus we required that the resulting fit have a negative derivative (higher \mks\ always gives lower mass) over the full range of input objects considered. We tested running without this constraint, and found similar results over most of the parameter range considered. The major difference was near the edges of the input sample. Without the negative derivative constraint, the fit would often become double valued where there were few points to constrain the fit.

To handle any variation not included in our formalism, we fit an additional dimensionless parameter $\sigma_e$. This parameter was implemented as a fractional uncertainty in the total mass, added to the measurement uncertainty (from the orbit and parallax errors) in quadrature. This parameter can be interpreted as missing physics (e.g., age, detailed abundances, and/or activity/rotation) driving an intrinsic scatter in the \mmk, or as underestimated uncertainties in our input parallaxes or orbital parameters (and hence the final assigned mass). Underestimated errors could arise from unaccounted binarity in the parallaxes or systematic errors in the astrometry, such as a missing or erroneous distortion solution or orientation for one or more of the instruments (including from the literature points). We tested implementing similar missing error terms on the assigned $K$-band magnitudes (in case of stellar variability) or directly on the parallax priors, and found consistent results. We opted to keep $\sigma_e$ as a fractional error on the total mass, which we feel is more physically motivated.

\subsection{Results and Uncertainties}

We show the resulting coefficient ($a_i$) posteriors in Figure~\ref{fig:fitpost}. The spread in the posteriors for individual coefficients is large, suggesting significant errors on each coefficient. However, the coefficients are also highly correlated; for a given value assigned to four of the five fit coefficients, there is a relatively narrow set of solutions for the final constant. The final fit was tightly constrained over the full sequence, which we show in Figure~\ref{fig:relation} for individual masses, and combined masses in Figure~\ref{fig:m_m} (a more realistic representation of how the fit was done).

The $\sigma_e$ parameter represents the fractional error in the total mass, added to account for intrinsic variation in the relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input masses.

Coefficients for powers of the same parity (even or odd) were strongly correlated to each other. This was expected, as a decrease in the slope (from linear) is best explained using an odd power, and increases with an even power. Coefficients for powers with even parity (with the exception of the $a_0$ term) were also generally centered around zero. This also was expected in the context of the shape of the relation seen in Figure~\ref{fig:relation}, and our requirement that the mass always decrease with decreasing luminosity (increasing \mks). A power with even parity will prefer to turn upwards at low masses. We explored this further by redoing the fit with no even powers (except $a_0$ was retained), but exploring higher-order odd powers. The resulting fit was significantly worse, with a $\sigma_e$ value twice as large compared fits with the same number of free parameters, but including even powers. The resulting fits also showed significant systematic deviations from the empirical data for $0.3M_\odot<M_*<0.5M_\odot$. We opted to include the even orders for all analyses despite their near-zero values. 

We adopted $n=\order$ as the preferred solution. Lower-order fits did a reasonable job fitting most of the sequence, but poorly reproduced the masses of objects with $M_*<0.085M_\odot$. In this regime, the relation becomes increasingly non-linear. The result is that lower-order fits systematically overestimate the masses of the coolest objects in our sample (Figure~\ref{fig:order}) and tend to overestimate $\sigma_e$ to compensate. Higher-order fits explain the data reasonably well, but were not justified statistically (e.g., marginal decrease in $\sigma_e$) and showed slope changes outside the calibration sample that are not expected by theoretical considerations.

The systematic offset seen between the low-mass sample and the best-fit relation can be seen in the coefficient posteriors as well as the best-fit relation (i.e., the distribution of fits are systematically high). }

To estimate the uncertainty in the relation we computed the standard deviation in the derived masses for a fixed \mks\ across all MCMC steps, which we report in Table~\ref{tab:err}. In the best-constrained regions ($5\lesssim$\mks$\lesssim7$, $0.3\lesssim M_*\lesssim0.6$) the scatter in the relation is $\lesssim$1\%, reaching $\simeq$3\% near the edges. These values in Table~\ref{tab:err} could potentially be used as a reference for estimating errors on the output mass for a given \mks\ if combined with errors from the distance and $K_S$ magnitude. 

However, this does not account for intrinsic scatter in the \mmk. To this end, we include error estimates including $\sigma_e$ as a proxy for intrinsic scatter. It is possible that $\sigma_e$ is purely a representation of missing uncertainties in the input parameters (e.g., orbital parameters, parallaxes, $K_S$). However, even in this case, we cannot rule out the presence of intrinsic variation at the level of $\sigma_e$ without removing (or at least characterizing) the missing errors. We advise using the errors that include $\sigma_e$ for all mass uncertainty estimates.

A more robust account of errors than using Table~\ref{tab:err} would be to use the full coefficient posteriors to account for asymmetry around the best-fit relation. To aid with this, we included the fit posteriors and a simple code that provides output $M_*$ posteriors\footnote{\href{https://github.com/awmann/M_-M_K-}{https://github.com/awmann/M\_-M\_K-}} given a $K_S$, distance, and associated uncertainties. The program combines the scatter in the coefficient posteriors with the median value of $\sigma_e$. Over most of the relation, particularly $0.1M_\odot<M_*<0.5M_\odot$, $\sigma_e$ is the dominant source of uncertainty in estimating masses. 

\subsection{The role of metallicity}\label{sec:metal}

We explored the the effects of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation using the Mesa Isochrones and Stellar Tracks \citep[MIST,][]{MIST0,MIST1}. We also tested models from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database \citep[DSEP,][]{Dotter2008}, and found results to be broadly in agreement. We preferred MIST because their model atmospheres include a newer set of molecular lines (e.g., TiO) that are important in M dwarfs and may impact the synthetic photometry. The Lyon models \citep[BHAC15,][]{BHAC15} employ a model atmosphere in reasonable agreement with nearby stars with interferometrically determined \teff\ values \citep{Boyajian2012,Mann2013c}, and go to lower masses than DSEP and MIST. However, the BHAC15 models cover only solar metallicity. 

We show the expected \mks\ tracks from MIST for different metallicities in Figure~\ref{fig:mk_metal} alongside our empirical determinations. MIST models do not extend below 0.1$M_\odot$, so we restricted our comparison to above that mass. For this comparison we assumed a fixed age of 5\,Gyr, although the choice of age from 1-10\,Gyr makes a negligible difference for the mass range shown (Figure~\ref{fig:age}). Note that metal-rich stars are expected to be {\it less luminous} in \mks\ (and $L_{\rm{bol}}$) for a fixed $M_*$, whereas the opposite trend is seen for a fixed \teff\ and most color selections. Above 0.4$M_\odot$ there is a slight trend for metal-rich stars in our sample to land below the median sequence, as expected from the models. However, many metal-poor stars also land below the sequence, and there is no obvious trend below 0.4$M_\odot$.

The residuals from our best-fit relation confirmed a weak (or no) effect on the derived $M_*$ due to changes in [Fe/H], as we show in Figure~\ref{fig:metal_resid}. A Spearman rank test yielded no significant correlation between the residuals and [Fe/H]. We tried resampling the measurements using their uncertainties, and $<$1\% of samples showed a significant correlation. We also repeated this test, but restricted to just the best-characterized systems ($<5\%$ precision on mass) and still found no significant trend with [Fe/H].

\end{figure}

Our sample is limited in its [Fe/H] range; 64\% of the targets are $-0.2<$[Fe/H]$<+0.2$ and only one target has [Fe/H]$<-0.5$. It is possible that our best-fit relation masked any [Fe/H] term by shifting the fit to match the typical metallicity of stars at a given \mks. We explored this by fitting for a term in [Fe/H] of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:mmk3}
M_{tot} &=& (1+f[\rm{Fe/H]})\left(10^{b_1} + 10^{b_2}\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $b_j$ is defined in Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2_b}. This form assumes that a linear change in [Fe/H] corresponds to a fractional change in $M_*$ (e.g., f=0.1 would correspond to a 10\% change in derived $M_*$ per dex in [Fe/H] for a fixed \mks). This is generally consistent with the evolutionary models, although there is a small change in the scale ($f$) over the range of masses considered here. 

For this analysis we excluded the two L dwarfs from the sample because of questionable assigned metallicities. As with our fit to Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk2}, we tested range of values for $n$ (number of $a_i$ coefficients). Our MCMC fitting method was otherwise identical to that outlined in Section~\ref{sec:relation}. Since we were primarily interested in the {\it relative} effect of [Fe/H], and not necessarily the absolute scale, we assumed the smaller (relative) errors on [Fe/H] (see Section~\ref{sec:feh}). 

We show the output coefficient posteriors in Figure~\ref{fig:fitpost_feh} and list the best-fit coefficients in Table~\ref{tab:coeff}. As with our fits neglecting $f$, we found significantly better agreement with the lowest-mass objects in the sample using $n=\order$, although $n=4$ and $n=6$ are listed in Table~\ref{tab:coeff} for reference. 

\begin{figure*}[p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.97\textwidth]{output_8feh_eMs.pdf}
\caption{Same as Figure~\ref{fig:fitpost}, but for the fit following Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3}, i.e., including the [Fe/H] term, $f$. }
\label{fig:fitpost_feh}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Interestingly, our $f$ value is consistent with zero (no impact of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation) at 1.7$\sigma$. This suggests our relation will work reasonably well even on more extreme metallicity samples (e.g., Halo stars). However, it is also possible that [Fe/H] is less important than abundances of elements that specifically impact the strength of molecular features in M dwarf spectra \citep[e.g., CO, Ti,][]{2012ApJ...747L..27F,Veyette2016a}. This also might explain some of the extra scatter in the relation ($\sigma_e$) if there is sufficient variance of these abundances in the given sample. Testing this will require a means to determine more detailed abundances of M dwarfs \citep[e.g.,][]{Veyette2017}, and/or to add in subdwarf binaries or other systems with more extreme abundances to provide increased leverage on any metallicity effects. 

To compare to the models, we fit the MIST grid points in the same manner as the empirical dataset following Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3}. In Figure~\ref{fig:f} we show the posterior on $f$ from the model grid compared to that from the dynamical masses. The models predict a significantly larger [Fe/H] effect then supported by our binary sample. The difference between the two posteriors ($f_{\rm{model}}-f_{\rm{dynamical}}$) is greater than zero at $4.1\sigma$. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{F_plot.eps}
\caption{Comparison of the posterior on $f$ (fractional change in $M_*$ per dex in metallicity for a fixed \mks; Equation~\ref{eqn:mmk3}) predicted by the MIST models (black) compared to that using our dynamical masses (red). There are an identical number of points in each posterior and the bin sizes are the same. }
\label{fig:f}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The difference between model and empirical predictions for $f$ holds for different subsets of the data and accounting for potential systematics in the assigned [Fe/H]. There is some evidence in the binary sample that [Fe/H] effects are stronger at the high-mass end (see Figure~\ref{fig:relation}). We tested this by repeating the analysis excluding binaries with one or more component masses below $0.35M_\odot$. While we found a marginally larger $f$ value using just the higher-mass sample ($f=0.056\pm0.035$\,dex$^{-1}$), this was still 2.5$\sigma$ discrepant from the model prediction and consistent with the result from the entire binary sample at $<1\sigma$. The difference also held if we restrict our sample to $0.1<M_\odot<0.6$, where the M dwarf [Fe/H] relations are best calibrated \citet{Mann2013a,Mann2014}.

The model discrepancy also cannot be explained by $\sigma_e$. Whatever interpretation we apply to this value, it only amounts to $\simeq$2\% variation in $M_*$ for a given \mks. The models predict a metallicity effect of $\simeq0.17$ per dex, and since our sample covers about 1 dex in [Fe/H], this translates to an expected $\simeq$17\% variation in mass over the full sample, or 8\% if we just consider the majority of the targets. It is possible that $\sigma_e$ is being driven in part by erroneous assigned [Fe/H] (or underestimated errors on [Fe/H]) which could decrease our derived $f$ value, but the effect is too small to reconcile with the models. 

Overestimating the effect of [Fe/H] may be related to missing opacity/molecular lines in the atmospheric models. Missing opacity at optical wavelengths could strengthen the effect of [Fe/H] by underestimating the number of saturated features (if a line is saturated adding [Fe/H] cannot make it stronger). The effect at NIR wavelengths would be weaker, since there are fewer molecular bands, but underestimated opacity in the optical would also change the continuum levels in the NIR as well as how those levels change with [Fe/H]. 

If the issue is related to the atmospheric models, the effect should change as a function of mass/\teff\ as molecular lines become stronger with decreasing temperature. However, this is hard to test with the current sample, since we don't have a large spread in [Fe/H] when compared to the [Fe/H] measurement uncertainties over the full mass range. Since the effect of [Fe/H] on the spectrum of M dwarfs is stronger at bluer wavelengths, optical flux ratios of our targets could help test this, as well as adding in more extreme metallicity systems. 

\subsection{Comparison to previous relations}\label{sec:other}

\subsubsection{\citet{Delfosse2000}}

\citet{Delfosse2000} provided one of the most commonly used \mmk\ relations, covering $0.1M_\odot<M_*0.6M_\odot$. Like our work, the calibration was built primarily on astrometric binaries. Nearly all the targets in \citet{Delfosse2000} were included in our sample, with the exception of triple systems and eclipsing binaries, both of which we intentionally avoided because of the complexity of computing total masses in the first scenario and estimating \mks\ in the latter. Because of the sample overlap, consistency is expected. However, a comparison can be useful to see how past use of \citet{Delfosse2000} may change with our more precise results.

We show the comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:delfosse}, including the points used in the \citet{Delfosse2000} calibration as well as the two fit lines. The relations are in agreement to better than 10\% over the full mass range considered, and within 5\% over most of the calibration region ($0.15M_\odot \lesssim M_* \lesssim 0.5M_\odot$). Given errors often quoted for the \citet{Delfosse2000} relation (5-10\%) the two fits are consistent. However, the relation presented here is a factor of 2-5$\times$ more precise over the whole mass regime.

The bottom panel shows the residual of the \citet{Delfosse2000} points compared to our relation.}
\label{fig:delfosse}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\citet{Mann2015b}}

\citet{Mann2015b} built a catalog of 183 M dwarfs with precise \teff\ and $R_*$, calibrated against radii measurements from long-baseline optical interferometry \citep{Boyajian2012} and precision bolometric fluxes \citep[e.g.,][]{Mann2015a,2015MNRAS.447..846B}. Masses were computed for these stars by interpolating the parameters onto an updated version of the DSEP models as described in \citet{Feiden2013,Feiden2014} and \citet{Muirhead2014}. Although these masses were model-dependent, they accurately reproduced the mass-radius relation from low-mass eclipsing binaries. This suggested that the model-based masses were accurate to $\simeq$3\% or better, and motivated the development of a \mmk\ relation from the \citet{Mann2015b} sample. A comparison to our relation can be seen in part as a test on the updated DSEP models, in addition to the results given in \citet{Mann2015b}. 

We show our fit with uncertainties alongside \citet{Mann2015b}'s in Figure~\ref{fig:mann}. The two fits track each other extremely well, with a maximum divergence of $\simeq$5\%. Given the quoted 2-3\% uncertainties from \citet{Mann2015b} and the 2-3\% errors in our relation, this difference is not significant. There is a hint of tension at the high-mass end, where our MCMC posterior is asymmetric, and at 0.2-0.3$M_\odot$ where the difference is the largest, but never does the the offset exceed the estimated uncertainties.

Residual is shown in the bottom panel. Individual points from \citet{Mann2015b} on which the calibration is based are not shown (for clarity), but they follow a tight sequence around the teal line. Only the range of masses covered by \citet{Mann2015b} are shown. }
\label{fig:mann}
\end{center}
\end{figure}




\subsubsection{\citet{Benedict2016}}
Like our work, the \citet{Benedict2016} relation was also based primarily on masses derived from M dwarf astrometric binaries. \citet{Benedict2016} sample uses absolute astrometry from {\it HST} fine guidance sensors and radial velocities for a subset of systems. In addition to the precision provided by {\it HST}, this combination yields individual (component) masses, and, in many cases, independent constraints on parallaxes. So although our sample is larger and contains most of the targets in \citet{Benedict2016}, their analysis is not subject to many of the complications of our own. 

We compare our \mmk\ relation \citet{Benedict2016}'s in Figure~\ref{fig:benedict}. The two relations are in excellent agreement for $0.09M_\odot\lesssim M_* \lesssim 0.25M_\odot$. Below this regime, the \citet{Benedict2016} fit is effectively anchored by one star, GJ1245C, because the two other stars in this low-mass regime (GJ 2005B and C) have relatively large errors. GJ1245AC is in our sample, but we use a parallax from \citet{GaiaDr2} on GJ 1245B for this system, which places it $10\sigma$ (2.5\%) more distant than the parallax adopted by \citet{Benedict2016}. Our parallax-free orbital parameters for this system are in excellent agreement with \citet{Benedict2016}, but the \citet{GaiaDr2} parallax makes the final parameters more consistent with our \mmk\ relation than adopting the \citet{Benedict2016} parallax. Since the \citet{Benedict2016} distance accounted for the binarity of this system, the origin of the difference between these two parallaxes is unclear. If GJ 1245B is itself an unresolved binary, this could explain the discrepant parallax (although there is no evidence of this). If the \citet{Benedict2016} parallax is correct, we need to explain why GJ 1245C is significantly more luminous than similar-mass stars, such as youth \citep{2015ApJ...800...95L,2017ApJ...834...85N}.

%It is possible that GJ1245 is young, which would help explain its luminosity. GJ1245ABC (B is $\simeq$7\arcsec\ away) all have sub-day rotation periods and show significant flaring \citep{2015ApJ...800...95L,2017ApJ...834...85N}. Late-M dwarfs lose their initial rotation slowly, so such short rotation periods and flare rates are not uncommon at this mass \citep{Newton2016,2018arXiv180307708P}. We can only conclude that GJ1245 is likely $<2$\,Gyr, which cannot necessarily explain its luminosity. Further, GJ1245A ($M_*=0.117M_\odot$, \mks=8.890) lands slightly {\it below} our relation, showing no evidence of overluminosity. The system would need to land in a narrow range of ages where A is solidly on the main-sequence, but C is still contracting \citep[$\simeq$400-600\,Myr based on Lyon models, ][]{BHAC15}. 

 Above 0.3$M_\odot$, \citet{Benedict2016} predicts masses as much as 10\% higher than our own for a fixed \mks. Our fit agrees reasonably well with the astrometric binaries fit by \citet{Benedict2016} in this mass regime. The divergence is driven instead, by literature mass determinations \citet{Benedict2016} included in their \mmk\ fit. Inspection of these literature points makes the origin of the discrepancy more clear; many are eclipsing binaries and have $\Delta K$-band magnitudes of mixed quality and/or lack parallaxes needed for a precise \mks. GU Boo, for example, has absolute magnitudes estimated from an optical eclipse depth combined with bolometric corrections \citep{Lopez2005}, which are drawn from models that perform poorly on M dwarfs \citep{1998A&AS..130...65L,Hauschildt1999}. Similarly, for GJ 2069 AC (CU Cnc) \citet{Benedict2016} adopted \mks\ from \citet{Ribas2003} that disagree with the 2MASS $K_S$ and {\it Gaia} DR2 parallax (for either AC or B) using any $\Delta K_S$. We conclude that the \mks\ determinations for these systems need to be revised before including them in future analyses of the \mmk\ relation.

%\subsection{Testing mass ratio predictions}
%One drawback of our ana

\section{Conclusions \& Discussion}\label{sec:discussion} 

\subsection{Summary}
The mass-luminosity relation has proven to be a critical tool for estimating masses of cool stars for decades, and has applications from studying extrasolar planets to measuring the initial mass function and mass-to-light ratio in massive galaxies. The \mmk\ relation has been particularly useful because \mks\ is easily measured if the stellar distance is known, and because it mitigates the effect of metallicity when compared to bluer bands. With the arrival of {\it Gaia} parallaxes combined with existing 2MASS photometry, nearly all the early M-dwarfs out to $\simeq$100\,pc and late M-dwarfs out to $\simeq$50\,pc have precise ($\lesssim1\%$) parallaxes and \mks\ magnitudes, massively increasing the utility of this relation. 

We endeavored to improve on existing \mmk\ relations and explore the role of [Fe/H] by expanding the sample of calibrators and using new techniques to measure the metallicity of binary M dwarfs. As part of this effort, we have been monitoring a set of nearby late K and M dwarf visual binaries using adaptive optics imaging with the goal of mapping their orbits and estimating their masses. We combined these data with similar data from Keck, CFHT, Gemini, and VLT archives, as well as astrometric measurements from the literature. The combination of literature astrometry and the recent Keck measurements were particularly important to provide the baseline on long-period ($P>10$ years) systems. 

We used these data to fit the orbits for 52 binaries, which we combined with parallaxes from the literature or derived from MEarth astrometry to determine the total masses of each system. We combined this with seven ultracool binaries from \citep{Dupuy2017}, which were analyzed in a nearly identical way to the procedure used in this paper and provide significantly improved coverage near the hydrogen burning limit. Seven binaries have total mass determinations better than 1\%, with a median precision of 6\%.

We used our dynamical masses and resolved \mks\ magnitudes to fit for an empirical relation between $M_*$ and \mks. The relation covers almost an order of magnitude in $M_*$, from $\simeq0.7M\odot$ down to the hydrogen burning limit ($\simeq0.075M_\odot$) and includes stars spanning the range of [Fe/H] expected for the Solar neighborhood ($-0.6<$[Fe/H]$<+0.4$)

The result provides masses precise to $\simeq$2\% over most of the M dwarf sequence. The uncertainty is limited primarily by scatter in the input masses around the best-fit beyond what is expected given their assigned mass uncertainties. We characterize this scatter with a free parameter ($\sigma_e$), which we find to be $\simeq$2\% for all fits. It is unclear if this term is a sign of intrinsic variation in the \mmk, possibly due to a missing astrophysical parameter (age, activity, detailed abundances, etc.) or underestimated errors in the input masses. Our adopted parallaxes, in particular, could have their uncertainties underestimated due to uncorrected orbital motion in the input astrometry. Although this does not impact many of our systems, for which the parallax was drawn from a wide proper motion companion or accounting for orbital motion, enough of the sample could be impacted by this to explain much of the missing 2\%. 

Using empirically calibrated spectroscopic abundances, we explored the role of [Fe/H] on the \mmk\ relation, comparing our results to expectations from evolutionary models as a guide. While the MIST models follow our empirical data relatively well, they significantly overestimate the importance of [Fe/H] in the \mmk\ relation (4.0$\sigma$). This difference does not appear to be due to systematics in the [Fe/H] estimates and holds even when we only include targets with the most reliable masses and/or metallicities. Interestingly, the effect of [Fe/H] is consistent with zero at 1.7$\sigma$, suggesting a metallicity effect so weak that we will need to include targets with more extreme metallicities to characterize it. 

We compared our relation to recent similar relations in the literature. Given quoted uncertainties, both the \citet{Delfosse2000} and \citet{Mann2015b} relations follow ours well over most of the sequence. Since the \citet{Mann2015b} masses are rooted in an updated version of the DSEP code, the level of agreement suggests that these models perform extremely well in predicting the masses of old, main-sequence M dwarfs. 

Our results agreed well with the observational sample of astrometric binaries analyzed by \citet{Benedict2016}, but our relation diverges from \citet{Benedict2016} above $\simeq0.35M_\odot$. We attribute this difference to literature points included in the \citet{Benedict2016} fit from earlier analyses (mostly eclipsing binaries) with uncertain distances and $\Delta K_S$ magnitudes. Increasing availability of {\it Gaia} parallaxes for these systems as well as ongoing efforts to measure their eclipses in range of wavelengths \citep[e.g.,][]{2017AJ....154..100H} should significantly improve their utility for studying the mass-luminosity relation of M dwarfs.


%\subsection{Complicating factors}


%%something about systematics in the AO data we analyzed?

%A more troubling scenario would be a mix of very low-mass objects (brown dwarfs) around a subset of the targets, such that no individual object appears as an outlier but the relation is statistically biased. We tested this by randomly adding companions to stars, assuming a conservative $\simeq20\%$ of M dwarf binaries are in triple systems \citep{Fischer1992}. Masses to the added companions were assigned assuming a uniform companion distribution, and periods following a log-normal distribution from \citet{Raghavan2010} and requiring a stability criterion of a 10:1 period ratio. We then excluded systems where the third star would have been detected, the resulting mass would make it $>3\sigma$ outlier in the \mmk\ relation, and those that would be detected using existing radial velocity data \citep{1999A&A...344..897D,Beu2004,Benedict2016} and show no evidence of an undetected triple. Further 

%% I think we should comment on how Dupuy stars at the HBL were selected. 

%Based on our selection criteria and lack of activity in the late K and early M dwarfs, we expect $>90\%$ of our sample to be older than 1-2\,Gyr \citep{2017ApJ...834...85N}. Many of the coolest stars in our sample are rapidly rotating and/or show H$\alpha$ emission \citep{Gaidos2014,2015ApJ...800...95L}, but not at atypical levels for even old stars in this mass range \citep{2015AJ....149..158S}. 


\subsection{Suggestions when using our \mmk\ relation}\label{sec:caveats}


To help users interested in using \mks\ to compute a realistic $M_*$ and $\sigma_{M_*}$ of single stars with parallaxes and $K_S$ magnitudes, we provide \href{https://github.com/awmann/M_-M_K-}{a simple code} to sample the fit posterior. {\bf Before using that code or the provided MCMC posteriors, take note of the following suggestions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The fit behaves poorly near the edges of the calibration sample. The scatter in the MCMC posterior accounts for this, but restrict use to $4.0<M_{K_S}<11.0$ ($0.075M_\odot<M_*<0.74M_\odot$), and a `safe' range would be $4.5<M_{K_S}<10.5$ ($0.08M_\odot<M_*<0.67M_\odot$). 

\item Our relation is only valid for main-sequence stars, and the roles of youth and activity are not accounted for here. Based on the Lyon models \citep{BHAC15}, we advise restricting use to $>$100\,Myr above $0.4M_\odot$, $>$300\,Myr to $0.2M_\odot$, $>$500\,Myr to $0.1M_\odot$, and $>1$\,Gyr below 0.1$M_\odot$. A safer cut would be to only use this on stars $>$1 Gyr, similar to the calibration sample. 

\item The result is only tested over $-0.60<\rm{[Fe/H]}<+0.45$. We provide a fit that attempts to take into account changes due to [Fe/H], but find a surprisingly weak effect. This suggests the [Fe/H]-free relation is safe to use over the range of metallicities expected in the Solar neighborhood (similar to the calibration sample). However, we advise caution when targeting more metal-poor populations like the thick disk or halo ([Fe/H]$\ll-0.5$) as we have no subdwarf binaries in our calibration set. The effects of more detailed abundances (e.g., [$\alpha$/Fe]) are completely untested.

\item The relation is only tested above the hydrogen burning limit. Since the boundary likely depends on metallicity \citep{2001RvMP...73..719B}, it is also not possible to use a simple $M_{K_S}$ cut even if the target is known to be old. Objects just below the hydrogen burning limit age slowly \citep{BHAC15}, so the relation given here may give reasonable results for many of these, but we urge caution when interpreting $M_*$ values for $M_{K_S}>10.5$. 

\item Since the origin of the $\sigma_e$ value is unclear, we suggest always including this as an irreducible source of error when estimating the mass of a target. 

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Future directions}

We intentionally selected targets that had $\Delta K$ measurements, as \mks\ was known to give the tightest relation with $M_*$ for M dwarfs. Unfortunately, there is no other band with contrast ratios for all systems considered here. Most of our monitoring was done with NIRC2 on Keck, so many systems have a $\Delta H$, but only about 1/3 of the sample have measurements in an optical band. This limits the utility of the sample, as {\it Gaia} $G$, $BP$, and $RP$ are now widely available for early and mid-M dwarfs, and are generally measured with better precision than 2MASS $K_S$. The growing capabilities of speckle cameras \citep[e.g.,][]{2009AJ....137.5057H} offer the opportunity to add optical contrasts. These can be converted to {\it Gaia} bandpasses, given reasonable assumptions about the component spectra, and used to derive a $M_{G}-M_*$ (or $M_G-M_*$-[Fe/H]) relation that can be easily applied to millions of K and M dwarfs. Complementary optical data also provide colors for individual components, from which we can measure component \teff\ and luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{2017ApJ...845...72K}.

Our sample was limited mostly to stars in the Solar neighborhood, and hence was heavily biased towards the narrow [Fe/H] distribution of nearby stars. We identified five additional [Fe/H]$<-0.5$ systems including two subdwarf binaries. However all systems had short baselines in the literature compared to their expected orbital periods. It may take 1-2 more years to complete their orbits at the required precision for this kind of analysis. The availability of {\it Gaia} parallaxes will also help improve the precision of the known metal-poor systems and aid in the identification of new ones. Lastly, as new methods arrive to measure detailed abundances of M dwarfs \cite{Veyette2016a,Veyette2017} we can explore effects beyond just [Fe/H]. This is especially useful for systems with large enough radial velocity differences between component stars to separate out individual spectra at high resolution.

%It is possible that the $\simeq$2\% error represented by $\sigma_e$ is due to much larger errors (5-10\%) but only for a smaller subset of the sample. In this case, since the targets 
%%there's another possibility here. Which is that the 2% sigma_e value is not 2% across the board, but it's like > 5-10% but only applies to a few targets (e.g, triples, totally pathological parallaxes, etc.). Since those targets have assigned masses that bear little resemblance to the real value, they will effectively be placed at a 'random' location on the Mk-mass diagram. Hence these points will always reduce the effect of [Fe/H]. The only way to get rid of this is to figure out what is the physical origin of the  

Although the sample studied here contained 118 stars, we only had half that many data points (59) constraining the fit, as the mass ratios were not known. This complicates the fit at the bottom of the sequence somewhat, where the relation is steeper. Here, small changes in the shape can have a larger impact on the implied mass ratio for a given system, providing a means to generate many reasonable solutions to the same set of system masses. This can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:relation} as a spread in the range of possible solutions \mks$>10$ despite relative well-determined masses for these systems. Later Gaia data releases will include full astrometry information, which, when combined with a measure of the flux ratio and our existing astrometry will enable a global fit for individual masses as well as the system parallax. 

The presence of unresolved tight companions (triples or quadruples) could bias the overall relation. A close-in third star orbiting one of the two binary components might be stable, and would not have been detected in our AO data. An unseen companion would drive the total mass of the system higher, but has much smaller effect on the total luminosity. So unresolved triples will sit {\it low} in Figure~\ref{fig:relation} (higher mass for a fixed \mks). A few stars do sit well below the fit, but no more so than expected given their mass uncertainties. Many of our targets have some radial velocity data in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{1999A&A...344..897D,Raghavan2010,Benedict2016}, which rule out the presence of any unresolved stellar companion. However a more detailed analysis 

Ages of our binary sample are not known, preventing any study into the effects of age on the \mmk\ relation. However, our larger sample of binaries with orbit measurements still in progress contains known members of nearby young moving groups and the Hyades cluster. Many of these have complete or nearly complete orbital solutions, and will soon provide a powerful set of mass benchmarks with known ages. These systems also span ages from 10-650\,Myr, offering the chance to both test pre-main-sequence models of M dwarfs \citep{2015ApJ...813L..11M,2016ApJ...817..164R,2016ApJ...818..156C,2016AJ....152..175N} and explore the role of activity on M dwarf parameters \citep[e.g.,][]{Spada2013,2018arXiv180404133K}. The current sample can be included in such work when combined with optical activity indicators and rotation periods like those expected from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \citep[{\it TESS},][]{2014SPIE.9143E..20R}. 

%We endeavored to select stars that land above the hydrogen burning limit, as stars below this range should not follow a strict mass-luminosity relation. Most of our objects near this boundary came from \citet{Dupuy2017}, and we adopted their classification as stellar or substellar. It is possible that some objects near the low-mass edge of our sample are brown dwarfs. Inclusion of any such substellar (old) systems would bias the fit towards higher $M_*$ for a given \mks. Objects just below this limit decline in luminosity slowly, and still may follow the same relation on $\simeq$Gyr timescales, so we expect this bias, if present, to be small. Further, the excellent agreement between all points $<0.85M_\odot$ suggests all objects are obeying the same \mmk\ relation (Figure~\ref{fig:relation}).

\section{Converting Observed $\Delta K_X$ to 2MASS $\Delta K_S$ for M dwarfs} \label{sec:a1}
To place all $K$-band magnitudes on the 2MASS system, we derived a relation between $\Delta K_X$ and $\Delta K_S$ as a function of $\Delta K_X$, where $X$ denotes the particular filter (e.g., $K_{\rm{cont}}$, $K'$) used for the AO observations. For photometry, we only used observations taken with a filter somewhere in the $K$-band (all wavelengths are used for astrometry), which included observations with the narrow Bracket-Gamma filter. 

To derive a conversion between contrasts, we used the 183 absolutely-flux calibrated spectra of nearby single stars from \citet{Mann2015b}, which cover a similar range of \teff\ and $M_*$ as the sample considered here. These spectra are mostly empirical; models are only used to fill in gaps in the spectrum or regions of high telluric contamination, none of which land in the regions covered by the filters considered here.

First we randomly sampled two stars from the sample and scaled the absolute level of each spectrum by the star's distance (effectively placing both at 1\,pc). We convolved each of the two stars with the relevant filter profiles for NIRC2\footnote{\href{https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/filters.html}{NIRC2 Filters}}, KIR\footnote{\href{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Filters/kir.html}{KIR Filters}}, NIRI\footnote{\href{http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/filters}{NIRI Filters}}, and NaCo\footnote{\href{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/inst/filters.html}{NACO Filters}}, and integrate over the wavelength range of the filters to compute the flux ($F$) in a given band. We used a filter profile for 2MASS $K_S$ from \citet{2003AJ....126.1090C}. The $\Delta K_X$ value for the given pair was then computed as $2.5log_{10}(F_1/F_2)$. 

We repeated this process with 5000 unique combinations of the 183 stars for 12 different filter/instrument combinations. For each filter and instrument combination we computed a best-fit line to $\Delta K_S -\Delta K_X$ as a function of $\Delta K_X$. We show four examples in Figure~\ref{fig:mags}. For the majority of the filters considered, the trend is insignificant compared to errors in the underlying spectra and absolute calibration ($\simeq0.02$\,mag). We did not apply a correction in these cases.

\caption{Difference between 2MASS $\Delta K_S$ and four example $\Delta m$ values measured from our AO imaging, built from a grid of absolutely-calibrated spectra and the filter profiles provided for each filter. No corrections are applied for the NIRC2 Bracket-Gamma (BrG) and $K_S$ (K-short) filter, as the trend is not significant compared to potential systematic issues in the calibration of the underlying spectra. }
\label{fig:mags}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

We did not see a significant difference in any derived correction based on the metallicity of the component stars, as expected based on how [Fe/H] changes $K$-band flux levels (Figure~\ref{fig:metal}). Thus we did not attempt to include [Fe/H] in these relations. We also found no significant effect as a function of the mass of the primary. However, this was difficult to test due to limitations of the input sample. The \citet{Mann2015b} spectral sample covers K7 to M7, but is poorly populated on the extreme ends. While we can make a wide range of combinations of low-contrast systems (M0+M0 to M6+M6), we have limited options for high-contrast (where primary can only be $\sim$ K7-M1) systems where temperature effects would be most clear.

\section{Orbits of binaries}\label{sec:orbitplots}

Here we show diagnostic plots of each of the binaries in our sample. Details of the input points data can be found in Section~\ref{sec:ao} for data analyzed in this paper and in Section~\ref{sec:litas} for astrometry from the literature. The orbital fitting method is described in Section~\ref{sec:orbit}.

In some fits, the range of orbital solutions is so small that the grey lines are not visible underneath the best-fit black line. Points are individual separation and position angle measurements with adopted uncertainties, color-coded by the data source (Gemini/NIRI in green, VLT/NaCo in blue, CFHT/PUEO in light red, Keck/NIRC2 in dark red, and literature data in light blue).
